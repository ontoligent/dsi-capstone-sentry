biopharmaceutical company that is seeking to discover, develop and commercialize innovative therapeutics for patients with certain cancers.&nbsp;Our preliminary focus is on the development of therapies for skin, lung and prostate cancers in the U.S.
market. Our proposed therapy is based upon the use of a patented formulation of the currently marketed anti-fungal drug itraconazole known as SUBA<SUP STYLE="font-size:85%; vertical-align:top">TM</SUP>-Itraconazole. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:8%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Following a meeting between our management and representatives of the United States Food and Drug Administration (or FDA) in August 2014, we
submitted an Investigational New Drug (or IND) application in November 2014 for the use of our product candidate to treat basal cell carcinoma in patients with Gorlin Syndrome, a genetic disease also known as Basal Cell Carcinoma Nevus Syndrome,
which, among other conditions, causes the chronic formation of basal cell tumors. Our IND application was cleared by the FDA&nbsp;&nbsp; in&nbsp; December 2014,&nbsp; and&nbsp;&nbsp; as such, we&nbsp; expect&nbsp;&nbsp; to&nbsp; commence&nbsp;
patient&nbsp;&nbsp; recruiting&nbsp; during&nbsp;&nbsp; the&nbsp; first&nbsp;&nbsp; quarter&nbsp; of&nbsp; 2015&nbsp; for&nbsp; a Phase&nbsp;II(b) clinical trial studying the safety and efficacy of the SUBA-Itraconazole formulation to determine how
well it reduces basal cell carcinoma tumor burden in patents with Gorlin Syndrome. We expect to report results during the second half of 2015 in patients who continue treatment under our open-label protocol.&nbsp;Thereafter, we intend going forward
to file individualized clinical trial protocols to expand the study of SUBA-Itraconazole for additional target cancer indications. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:8%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">We
have developed, licensed and are seeking to acquire and/or license, intellectual property and know-how related to the treatment of cancer patients using itraconazole and have applied for patents to cover our inventions. We have exclusive rights in
the U.S. to develop and to commercialize SUBA-Itraconazole Capsules for the treatment of human cancer via oral administration. SUBA-Itraconazole was developed and is licensed to us by our manufacturing partner and significant shareholder Mayne
Pharma Ventures Pty Ltd. and its affiliates (which we refer to herein as Mayne Pharma) under a Supply and License Agreement, originally dated September&nbsp;3, 2013 and most recently amended and restated on June&nbsp;24, 2014. We refer to this
agreement herein as the Supply and License Agreement. Mayne Pharma is an Australian specialty pharmaceutical company that develops and manufactures branded and generic products, which it distributes directly or through distribution partners and also
provides contract development and manufacturing services. In addition to being our licensor and supply partner, under the Supply and License Agreement and related agreements, Mayne Pharma holds a significant minority equity stake in our company and
holds important rights with respect to our company, such as the right to appoint a member to our Board of Directors. In addition, we expect to obtain a sublicense from Mayne Pharma to rights for certain patents regarding the use of itraconazole as a
cancer treatment. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:8%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">&#147;SUBA<SUP STYLE="font-size:85%; vertical-align:top">TM</SUP>&nbsp;technology&#148; (which stands for &#147;super
bioavailability&#148;) is designed to improve the bioavailability of orally administered drugs that are poorly soluble. In studies conducted by Mayne Pharma relating to SUBA-Itraconazole&#146;s anti-fungal application, SUBA-Itraconazole has
demonstrated improved absorption and significantly reduced variability compared to the branded and generic forms of itraconazole in human studies. We believe this technology is well-suited for the exploration of the potential anti-cancer effects of
itraconazole. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:8%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Based on existing scientific (including in vitro, animal and human studies) data, we believe that itraconazole affects the
Hedgehog signaling pathway in cells, a major regulator of many fundamental cellular processes, which will in turn impact the development and growth of certain cancers. Itraconazole appears to have notable anti-cancer effects by one or more
independent or synergistic mechanisms, some of which are not clearly understood and continue to be the subject of on-going research. These anti-cancer effects have been demonstrated in various animal models and subsequently in human studies

<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:8%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Our regulatory strategy is driven by the so called 505(b)(2) regulatory pathway, under which a drug (in our case, itraconazole) that has
already been approved for use in humans in the United States by the FDA is developed for one or more new medical indications (in our case, as an anti-cancer agent). Due to the history of safe and efficacious use of itraconazole in humans for
anti-fungal applications, we believe the 505(b)(2) pathway will be available to us, which may create the potential for significantly reducing the risk and time to achieve FDA approval of our cancer therapy. </P>

<P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:8%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Our predecessor, Commonwealth Biotechnologies, Inc. (which we refer to as CBI), was founded as a Virginia corporation in 1992, and completed an
initial public offering in October 1997. Its business model was providing, on a contract basis, specialized life sciences services to the pharmaceutical and biotechnology sector. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:8%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">On January&nbsp;20, 2011, CBI filed a voluntary petition in the Bankruptcy Court for the Eastern District of Virginia seeking relief under the
provisions of Chapter 11 of Title 11 of the United States Code (or the Bankruptcy Code). The Chapter 11 case was captioned <I>In re Commonwealth Biotechnologies, Inc.</I>, Case No.&nbsp;11-30381-KRH. On January&nbsp;4, 2013, CBI filed an Amended
Plan of Reorganization (or the Plan) with the Bankruptcy Court. The Plan was approved by a vote of creditors and CBI stockholders on March&nbsp;21, 2013. Hedgepath, LLC, a Florida limited liability company and a significant stockholder of our
company of which our current Executive Chairman acts as manager, was the winning bidder for CBI (which is sometimes referred to herein as HPPI in its capacity as the reorganized company, after giving effect to the consummation of the transactions
contemplated by the reincorporation merger and acquisition described below). CBI received an auction fee of $30,000 from Hedgepath, LLC in addition to an agreement to contribute certain assets related to our current business of commercializing
innovative therapeutics for patients with cancer using the approved pharmaceutical itraconazole (which we refer to as the Itra Business Opportunity), as further described below. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:8%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">On March&nbsp;29, 2013, the Bankruptcy Court entered an order confirming the Plan pursuant to Chapter 11 of the Bankruptcy Code, and on
April&nbsp;17, 2013, CBI issued a press release announcing the effectiveness of such confirmation order. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:8%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Under the terms of the Plan, and
pursuant to a Contribution Agreement, dated August&nbsp;13, 2013, Hedgepath, LLC contributed and assigned to HPPI certain assets relating to the Itra Business Opportunity, as the reorganized debtor, in exchange for 90% of fully diluted voting equity
in HPPI (in the form of newly issued Series A Preferred Stock) on the date of issuance, with the prior stockholders of CBI retaining approximately 10% voting equity in HPPI, represented by 100% of HPPI&#146;s issued and outstanding shares of Common
Stock. As the elements of the Plan have been implemented (including the payment in full of all company creditors), HPPI formally closed CBI&#146;s bankruptcy case on September&nbsp;20, 2013. </P>

pursuant to which CBI changed its name to &#147;HedgePath Pharmaceuticals, Inc.&#148; and became reincorporated as a Delaware corporation. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:8%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">On August&nbsp;13, 2013, HPPI and Hedgepath LLC consummated the transactions contemplated by the Contribution Agreement, including the
acquisition of Itra Business Opportunity assets, as contemplated by the Plan. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:8%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Prior to such transactions, CBI was a shell company, as
defined in Rule 12b-2 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, having been subject to bankruptcy proceedings and with no operations. CBI formally emerged from Chapter 11 bankruptcy following the consummation of such transactions, which
satisfied the final condition to effectiveness of the Plan. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:18pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B>The Hedgehog Pathway </B></P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:8%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The Hedgehog signaling pathway is a major regulator of many fundamental cellular processes in vertebrates, including primarily at the embryonic
stage of development but also as it relates to stem cell maintenance, cell differentiation, tissue polarity and cell proliferation. Based on published research, we believe that inhibiting the Hedgehog pathway could delay or possibly prevent the
development of certain cancers in patients. Research has shown that activation of the Hedgehog pathway can lead to the formation of cancerous tumors (a process known as tumorigenesis) such as the most common form of skin cancer known as basal cell
carcinoma. A variety of other human cancers, including brain, gastrointestinal, lung, breast and prostate cancers, also demonstrate inappropriate activation of this pathway. Hedgehog signaling from the tumor to the surrounding cell structures has
been shown to sometimes promote further tumorigenesis as well. This pathway has also been shown to regulate proliferation of cancer stem cells and to increase tumor invasiveness. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:8%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">We believe that the targeted inhibition of Hedgehog signaling may be effective in the treatment and prevention of many types of human cancers.
We also believe that the discovery and synthesis of specific Hedgehog pathway inhibitors may have significant clinical implications regarding the development of novel cancer therapies. Several synthetic Hedgehog antagonists are now being studied,
some of which are undergoing clinical evaluation. The orally available compound, GDC-0449 (vismodegib, developed by Genentech, Inc., a subsidiary of Roche), is the first Hedgehog inhibitor based-therapy that has been approved for treatment of
advanced stages of basal cell carcinoma by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:18pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B>Repurposing Itraconazole for Treating Cancer </B></P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:8%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">We are implementing clinical and regulatory plans to enable the repurposing of itraconazole, via the use of the new formulation of
SUBA-Itraconazole oral capsules, for the treatment of a variety of cancers. This strategy is intended to significantly reduce the risk and time to potential FDA approvals for marketing in the United States. Initial target applications include
therapies for skin, lung and prostate cancers, among others. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:8%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Itraconazole appears to have notable anti-cancer effects by one or more
independent or synergistic mechanisms, some of which are not clearly understood and continue to be the subject of ongoing research. These anti-cancer effects have been demonstrated in various animal models and, subsequently in human studies over the
last few years, all of which are the basis of our interest in the clinical development of SUBA-Itraconazole for treatment of human cancers. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:8%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">We believe that our development of SUBA-Itraconazole as an anti-cancer therapy may lead to its use as an inhibitor of the Hedgehog pathway,
thereby retarding the progression of cancer. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:8%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">In animal models, itraconazole has demonstrated an anti-angiogenic effect (i.e., inhibiting
the formation of new blood vessels), which may be important in controlling the proliferation of cancerous cells and tumors in humans based upon its interaction with certain cell-based growth factors. Itraconazole also appears to induce changes
related to the mTOR pathway, an important regulator of cell growth, proliferation and survival which, when unregulated, can also lead to cancer. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:8%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">We believe that the use of SUBA-Itraconazole to treat each of our target cancer patient populations has the potential to benefit from various
FDA programs designed to expedite the approval process. </P>

<P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:8%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">SUBA-Itraconazole may offer a significant alternative therapy to Genentech&#146;s drug, vismodegib, for treatment of basal cell carcinoma
(known as BCC). Vismodegib is the first FDA-approved Hedgehog inhibitor based-therapy, yet has many reported toxicities and is associated with serious side effects that result in suspension of chronic dosing. As a result, basal cell tumors reoccur
and patients are faced with the choice of returning to vismodegib therapy or, if possible, surgical alternatives. The SUBA-Itraconazole formulation of itraconazole may prove to be a more acceptable therapy for a larger number of patients or
considered as a therapy which could easily be alternated with vismodegib, especially for patients who cannot endure vismodegib side-effects for extended periods or treatment. Additionally, recent reports indicate that vismodegib has led to
resistance in some BCC patients, so use of SUBA-Itraconazole as an alternative therapy in this sub-population of patients could prove to be very useful for long term oral drug therapy. SUBA-Itraconazole treatment of patients with Gorlin Syndrome (a
genetic disease which causes chronic BCC tumors) may qualify for orphan drug status, an FDA designation that expedites review of drugs for the treatment of diseases that have relatively small patient populations. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:18pt; margin-bottom:0pt; margin-left:8%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><I>Lung Cancer </I></P> <P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:8%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Patients
with advanced non-squamous non-small cell lung cancer (most often caused by cigarette smoking) have few options when considering therapies to extend survival. With a median survival of only 8-10 months while on approved chemotherapy regimens, we
believe that new therapies are needed. We believe that the pre-clinical data and recently reported human data on the use of itraconazole in conjunction with chemotherapy reflects positively on the use of itraconazole as an anti-cancer therapy for
this form of lung cancer. If these data prove to be applicable to human treatment by improving survival, while dosing SUBA-Itraconazole in combination with first-line chemotherapy therapy (the combination of chemotherapy drugs Pemetrexed and
Cisplatin), the treatment may qualify for one or more FDA accelerated programs, such as a breakthrough therapy or fast track status. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:18pt; margin-bottom:0pt; margin-left:8%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><I>Prostate Cancer </I></P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:8%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Itraconazole has already been tested as a treatment for men with metastatic castrate resistant prostate cancer in a multi-institutional Phase
II trial led by Johns Hopkins University and completed in 2011 and published in 2013, which showed that, at a specified dose, there was a significant correlation to slowing the progression of cancer and extending survival. Based on those encouraging
results in metastatic disease, we are planning to test SUBA- Itraconazole in high-risk men with non-metastatic prostate cancer (who are castrate resistant, either based upon drug therapy or surgery) to study the effect of itraconazole therapy in
delaying metastases. There is no currently approved drug therapy for these patients and yet they are treated with drugs designed for metastatic disease on an &#147;off-label&#148; basis. We believe this is a significant opportunity for us since we
are offering a non-toxic, non-androgen dependent small molecule therapy to a very large population of patients. Therapy with SUBA-Itraconazole may offer great promise for delaying the use of, and associated side-effects due to, those Androgen
Deprivation Therapy (ADT) Drugs which are formulated to lower testosterone levels but are intended for metastatic disease treatment. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:18pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B>Our Potential

Cancer </B></P> <P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:8%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Cancer is a heterogeneous group of diseases characterized by uncontrolled cell division and growth. Cancerous cells that arise
in the lymphatic system and bone marrow are referred to as hematological tumors. Cancer cells that arise in other tissues or organs are referred to as solid tumors. Researchers believe that exposure to some chemicals, viruses and various forms of
radiation can cause genetic alterations that cause cancer. Genetic predispositions also can increase the risk of cancer in some people. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:8%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Cancer is the second leading cause of death in the United States, exceeded only by heart disease. The American Cancer Society estimates that
in 2013 there were approximately 1.6&nbsp;million new cases of cancer and approximately 580,000 deaths from cancer in the United States. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:8%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The most common methods of treating patients with cancer are surgery, radiation and drug therapy. A cancer patient often receives treatment
with a combination of these methods. Surgery and radiation therapy are particularly effective in patients in whom the disease is localized (not spread beyond the initial site of disease). Physicians generally use systemic drug therapies in
situations in which the cancer has spread beyond the primary site or cannot otherwise be treated through surgery. The goal of drug therapy is to damage and kill cancer cells or to interfere with the molecular and cellular processes that control the
development, growth and survival of cancer cells or tumors. In many cases, drug therapy entails the administration of several different drugs in combination. Over the past several decades, drug therapy has evolved from non-specific drugs that damage
both healthy and cancerous cells, to drugs that target specific molecular pathways involved in cancer and more recently to therapeutics that target the specific oncogenic &#147;drivers&#148; of cancer. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:8%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><I>Cytotoxic Chemotherapies.</I> The earliest approach to pharmacological cancer treatment was to develop drugs, referred to as cytotoxic
drugs, which kill rapidly proliferating cancer cells through non-specific mechanisms, such as disrupting cell metabolism or causing damage to cellular components required for survival and rapid growth. While these kinds of drugs have been effective
in the treatment of some cancers, many unmet medical needs for the treatment of cancer remain. Also, cytotoxic drug therapies act in an indiscriminate manner, acting upon the metabolism of healthy as well as cancerous cells. Due to their mechanism
of action, many cytotoxic drugs have a narrow dose range above which the toxicity causes unacceptable or even fatal levels of damage and below which the drugs are not effective in eradicating cancer cells. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:8%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><I>Targeted Therapies.</I> The next approach to pharmacological cancer treatment was to develop drugs, referred to as targeted therapeutics,
that target specific biological molecules in the human body that play a role in rapid cell growth and the spread of cancer. Targeted therapeutics include vascular disruptors, also referred to as angiogenesis inhibitors, which prevent the formation
of new blood vessels and restrict a tumor&#146;s blood supply. Other targeted therapies affect cellular signaling pathways that are critical for the growth of cancer. While these drugs have been effective in the treatment of some cancers, most do
not address the underlying cause of the disease. These drugs focus on inhibiting processes that help the cancer cell survive, but not the oncogenes that are the drivers or cause of the cancer itself. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:8%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><I>Oncogenic Therapies.</I> A more recent approach to pharmacological cancer treatment is to develop drugs that affect the drivers that cause
uncontrolled growth of cancer cells because of a specific genetic alteration. In some cases, these agents were identified as therapeutics without knowledge of the underlying genetic change causing the disease. To date, the shortcoming of this
research approach has been that it often follows a conventional trial and error approach to drug discovery. In this approach, clinical development involves the treatment of large populations from which a defined subpopulation that responds to
treatment is identified. As a result, this approach can be time-consuming and costly, with success often uncertain. Another major concern of these newly discovered drugs, some of which have been recently approved, is that resistance to them occurs
as the cancer finds new ways to circumvent the genetic pathway. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:18pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B>The Itraconazole Approach to Treating Cancer </B></P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:8%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">We are focusing our developments on Hedgehog pathway inhibitor therapeutics for patients with certain cancers, including skin, lung and
prostate cancers. Our initial product candidate is a new formulation of itraconazole, which is based upon new drug </P>

delivery technology that enhances its bioavailabilty. Previous formulations of itraconazole have exhibited anti-cancer properties in human trials and therefore, based on pre-clinical research
regarding specific indicators of Hedgehog pathway inhibition, we believe have compelling evidence of being potential Hedgehog inhibitors for treatment of cancer in humans. We have obtained exclusive U.S. rights to use and develop SUBA-Itraconazole,
a patented, more bioavailable formulation of the currently marketed drug itraconazole, which we have licensed from Mayne Pharma through an exclusive Supply and License Agreement. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:8%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><I>Background of Itraconazole.</I> Itraconazole is FDA approved for and used to treat serious fungal or yeast infections. This medicine works
by killing the fungus or yeast and preventing its growth. Itraconazole is a prescription based medication, available as an IV solution, oral liquid, capsule or tablet. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:8%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><I>Cancer and Hedgehog Inhibitors.</I> The Hedgehog (also known as Hh) proteins comprise a group of secreted proteins that regulate cell
growth, differentiation and survival. They are involved in organogenesis (the formation of organs), and have been shown to promote adult stem cell proliferation. Inappropriate activation of the Hh signaling pathway has been implicated in the
development of several&nbsp;types of cancers including prostate, lung, pancreas, breast, brain and skin. Hedgehog pathway inhibitors are a relatively new class of therapeutic agents that act by targeting the proteins involved in the regulation of
the Hh pathway. Many of these newly discovered inhibitors are currently undergoing preclinical testing and some have entered clinical studies as anti-cancer agents for a variety of cancers. Vismodegib was approved for treatment of locally advanced
and metastatic basal cell carcinoma in early 2012. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:8%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Similarly, itraconazole has also been shown to suppress growth of brain tumors in
animal models. It has also been shown to have anti-cancer effects in basal cell carcinoma, lung cancer and prostate cancer in human clinical trials. Itraconazole acts as a SMO (a protein receptor of the Hh pathway) antagonist (blocker), in a manner
distinct from its anti-fungal activity which targets a compound found in fungi and yeast known as ergosterol (a steroid found in the cell walls of fungi and yeast that functions in a fashion similar to cholesterol in humans) as well as having
anti-angiogenic properties. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:18pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B>Intellectual Property </B></P>

importing, promoting, marketing, distributing or selling SUBA-Itraconazole for the treatment of cancer in the United States. If any other form of the SUBA-Itraconazole manufactured by Mayne Pharma is sold as a result of any non-promoted use, we
shall be entitled to a royalty on such non-promoted sales. Further, during the term of and for a period following the term of the Supply and License Agreement, we may not develop products that are competitive with SUBA-Itraconazole for the treatment
of cancer. Under the Supply and License Agreement, we are responsible for obtaining all of our requirements for SUBA-Itraconazole from Mayne Pharma, including for use in clinical trials, importation, promotion, marketing, sale and distribution in
the United States. We and Mayne Pharma have established certain minimum floor prices that we must pay per unit of SUBA-Itraconazole and minimum order quantities for SUBA-Itraconazole. In addition, the agreement provides for certain annual minimum
order quantities for SUBA-Itraconazole, and, if such quantities are not met, we must pay the shortfall or Mayne Pharma may terminate the agreement. In addition, we expect to gain access via sublicense to certain patents relating to itraconazole as a
cancer treatment. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:8%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">On June&nbsp;24, 2014, we and Mayne Pharma, along with Nicholas J. Virca, our President and Chief Executive Officer,

License Agreement. In addition, on June&nbsp;24, 2014, in fulfillment of one of the conditions under the Supply and License Agreement, we entered into a Securities Purchase Agreement with Mayne Pharma (which we refer to as the Mayne Purchase
Agreement). Pursuant to the terms of the Mayne Purchase Agreement, we issued to Mayne Pharma (i)&nbsp;258,363.280 shares of our Series A Preferred Stock, and (ii)&nbsp;a warrant to purchase 10,250,569 shares of our common stock. The shares of Series
A Preferred Stock converted into 87,843,897 shares of common stock on August&nbsp;14, 2014. Such warrant has an exercise price of $0.0878 per share and may be exercised at any time, from time to time, by Mayne Pharma prior to the expiration on
June&nbsp;24, 2019. As a result of the Mayne Purchase Agreement, Mayne Pharma owns approximately 38% of our equity securities on a fully diluted basis. See &#147;Certain Relationships and Related Transactions&#148; for further information. In
addition, we entered into an Equity Holders Agreement with Mayne Pharma which is discussed further in &#147;Certain Relationships and Related Transactions&#148;. </P>

stages of development and thus have not yet established a sales, marketing or product distribution infrastructure because our product candidate is still in clinical development. We may either license commercialization rights to our product candidate
to larger third party partners, who will be responsible for sales, distribution and marketing efforts, or we may (assuming adequate resources are available) retain commercial rights for our product candidate, in which case we would seek to access
the oncology market through a focused, specialized sales force of our own or in conjunction with a marketing partner under a co-promotion agreement. </P>

is highly competitive and subject to rapid and substantial regulatory and technological changes. Developments by others may render our itraconazole therapies, or any proposed product candidates and formulations under development, non-competitive or
obsolete, or we may be unable to keep pace with anti-cancer therapy developments or other market factors. Anti-cancer therapy competition from pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies, universities, governmental entities and others diversifying
into the field is intense and is expected to increase. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:8%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Below are some examples of companies seeking to develop potentially competitive
anti-cancer therapies or related products, though the examples are not all-inclusive. Many of these entities have significantly greater research and development capabilities than do we, as well as substantially more marketing, manufacturing,
financial and managerial resources. These entities represent significant competition for us. In addition, acquisitions of, or investments in, competing pharmaceutical or biotechnology companies by large corporations could increase such
competitors&#146; research, financial, marketing, manufacturing and other resources. Such potential competitive anti-cancer therapies may ultimately prove to be safer, more effective or less costly than any product candidates that we are currently
developing or may be able to develop. Additionally, our competitive position may be materially affected by our ability to develop or commercialize our drugs and technologies before any such competitor. Other external factors may also impact the
ability of our products to meet expectations or effectively compete, including pricing pressures, healthcare reform and other government interventions. </P>

laboratory evaluation of product chemistry, toxicity and formulation, as well as animal studies to assess potential safety and efficacy. An IND sponsor must submit the results of the preclinical tests, together with manufacturing information,
analytical data and any available clinical data or literature, among other things, to the FDA as part of an IND. Some preclinical testing may continue even after the IND is submitted. An IND automatically becomes effective 30 days after receipt by
the FDA, unless before that time the FDA raises concerns or questions related to one or more proposed clinical trials and places the clinical trial on a clinical hold. In such a case, the IND sponsor and the FDA must resolve any outstanding concerns
before the clinical trial can begin. As a result, submission of an IND may not result in the FDA allowing clinical trials to commence. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:8%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">We
have successfully avoided pre-clinical studies or any Phase I studies to demonstrate safety based on the fact that itraconazole has an established history of safe and effective use in humans for anti-fungal indications based upon the fact that human
data are already available and published regarding use of itraconazole in humans for anti-cancer indications, such as basal cell carcinoma, lung cancer and prostate cancer, at the Phase II level and the December 2014 clearance of our IND for human
testing in a Phase II(b) clinical trial scheduled for 2015. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:8%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><I>Clinical Trials.</I> Clinical trials involve the administration of the
investigational new drug to human subjects under the supervision of qualified investigators in accordance with GCP requirements, which include the requirement that all research subjects provide their informed consent in writing for their
participation in any clinical trial. Clinical trials are conducted under protocols detailing, among other things, the objectives of the trial, the parameters to be used in monitoring safety and the effectiveness criteria to be evaluated. A protocol
for each clinical trial and any subsequent protocol amendments must be submitted to the FDA as part of the IND. In addition, an IRB (institutional review board) at each institution participating in the clinical trial must review and approve the plan
for any clinical trial before it commences at that institution, and the IRB must continue to oversee the clinical trial while it is being conducted. Information about certain clinical trials must be submitted within specific timeframes to the
National Institutes of Health, or NIH, for public dissemination on their ClinicalTrials.gov website. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:8%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Human clinical trials are typically
conducted in three sequential phases, which may overlap or be combined. In Phase I, the drug is initially introduced into healthy human subjects or patients with the target disease or condition and tested for safety, dosage tolerance, absorption,
metabolism, distribution, excretion and, if possible, to gain an initial indication of its effectiveness. In Phase II, the drug typically is administered to a limited patient population to identify possible adverse effects and safety risks, to
preliminarily evaluate the efficacy of the product for specific targeted diseases and to determine dosage tolerance and optimal dosage. In Phase III, the drug is administered to an expanded patient population, generally at geographically dispersed
clinical trial sites, in well-controlled clinical trials to generate enough data to statistically evaluate the efficacy and safety of the product for approval, to establish the overall risk-benefit profile of the product and to provide adequate
information for the labeling of the product. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:8%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Progress reports detailing the results of the clinical trials must be submitted at least
annually to the FDA and more frequently if serious adverse events occur. Phase I, Phase II and Phase III clinical trials may not be completed successfully within any specified period, or at all. Furthermore, the FDA or the sponsor may suspend or
terminate a clinical trial at any time on various grounds, including a finding that the research subjects are being exposed to an unacceptable health risk. Similarly, an IRB can suspend or terminate approval of a clinical trial at its institution if
the clinical trial is not being conducted in accordance with the IRB&#146;s requirements or if the drug has been associated with unexpected serious harm to patients. As mentioned previously, we are moving directly into Phase II trials with
SUBA-Itraconazole for our targeted anti-cancer indications based upon the previous, well-established safety profile of itraconazole use in humans for treatment of anti-fungal indications and based upon the previous human data regarding the use of
itraconazole for anti-cancer indications such as basal cell carcinoma, lung cancer and prostate cancer and the IND clearance by FDA which occurred in December 2014. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:8%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><I>Marketing Approval.</I> Assuming successful completion of the required clinical testing, the results of the preclinical and clinical
studies, together with detailed information relating to the product&#146;s chemistry, manufacture, controls and proposed labeling, among other things, are submitted to the FDA as part of an NDA requesting approval to market the product for one or
more indications. In most cases, the submission of an NDA is subject to a substantial application user fee. Under the Prescription Drug User Fee Act (or PDUFA) guidelines that are currently in effect, the FDA has agreed to certain performance goals
regarding the timing of its review of an application. </P>

 <P STYLE="margin-top:0pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:8%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The FDA also may require submission of a risk evaluation and mitigation strategy (or REMS) plan
to mitigate any identified or suspected serious risks. The REMS plan could include medication guides, physician communication plans, assessment plans, and elements to assure safe use, such as restricted distribution methods, patient registries or
other risk minimization tools. We believe that a REMS program, which includes intellectual property related to SUBA-Itraconazole and itraconazole, and the specific use of SUBA-Itraconazole for anti-cancer indications, may likely provide additional
protection of our proposed therapies from generic substitution. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:8%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The FDA conducts a preliminary review of all NDAs within the first 60
days after submission, before accepting them for filing, to determine whether they are sufficiently complete to permit substantive review. The FDA may request additional information rather than accept an NDA for filing. In this event, the
application must be resubmitted with the additional information. The resubmitted application is also subject to review before the FDA accepts it for filing. Once the submission is accepted for filing, the FDA begins an in-depth substantive review.
The FDA reviews an NDA to determine, among other things, whether the drug is safe and effective and whether the facility in which it is manufactured, processed, packaged or held meets standards designed to assure the product&#146;s continued safety,
quality and purity. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:8%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The FDA typically refers a question regarding a novel drug to an external advisory committee. An advisory committee
is a panel of independent experts, including clinicians and other scientific experts, that reviews, evaluates and provides a recommendation as to whether the application should be approved and under what conditions. The FDA is not bound by the
recommendations of an advisory committee, but it considers such recommendations carefully when making decisions. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:8%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Before approving an NDA,
the FDA typically will inspect the facility or facilities where the product is manufactured. The FDA will not approve an application unless it determines that the manufacturing processes and facilities are in compliance with cGMP requirements and
adequate to assure consistent production of the product within required specifications. Additionally, before approving an NDA, the FDA will typically inspect one or more clinical trial sites to assure compliance with GCP. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:8%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">After evaluating the NDA and all related information, including the advisory committee recommendation, if any, and inspection reports
regarding the manufacturing facilities and clinical trial sites, the FDA may issue an approval letter, or, in some cases, a complete response letter. A complete response letter generally contains a statement of specific conditions that must be met
in order to secure final approval of the NDA and may require additional clinical or preclinical testing in order for FDA to reconsider the application. Even with submission of this additional information, the FDA ultimately may decide that the
application does not satisfy the regulatory criteria for approval. If and when those conditions have been met to the FDA&#146;s satisfaction, the FDA will typically issue an approval letter. An approval letter authorizes commercial marketing of the
drug with specific prescribing information for specific indications. Even if the FDA approves a product, it may limit the approved indications for use of the product, require that contraindications, warnings or precautions be included in the product
labeling, including a boxed warning, require that post-approval studies, including Phase 4 clinical trials, be conducted to further assess a drug&#146;s safety after approval, require testing and surveillance programs to monitor the product after
commercialization, or impose other conditions, including distribution restrictions or other risk management mechanisms under a REMS (Risk Evaluation Mitigation Strategy) which can materially affect the potential market and profitability of the
product. The FDA may prevent or limit further marketing of a product based on the results of post-marketing studies or surveillance programs. After approval, some types of changes to the approved product, such as adding new indications,
manufacturing changes, and additional labeling claims, are subject to further testing requirements and FDA review and approval. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:8%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><I>Special FDA Expedited Review and Approval Programs.</I> The FDA has various programs, including fast track designation, accelerated
approval, priority review and breakthrough designation, that are intended to expedite or simplify the process for the development and FDA review of drugs that are intended for the treatment of serious or life threatening diseases or conditions and
demonstrate the potential to address unmet medical needs. The purpose of these programs is to provide important new drugs to patients earlier than under standard FDA review procedures. To be eligible for a fast track designation, the FDA must
determine, based on the request of a sponsor, that a product is intended to treat a serious or life threatening disease or condition and demonstrates the potential to address an unmet medical need. The FDA will determine that a product will fill an
unmet medical need if it will provide a therapy where none exists or provide a therapy that may be potentially superior to existing therapy based on efficacy or safety factors. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:8%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The FDA may give a priority review designation to drugs that offer major advances in treatment, or provide a treatment where no adequate
therapy exists. A priority review means that the goal for the FDA to review an application is six months, rather than the standard review of ten months under current PDUFA guidelines. These six and ten month review periods are measured from the
&#147;filing&#148; date rather than the receipt date for NDAs for new molecular entities, which typically adds approximately two months to the timeline for review and decision from the date of submission. Most products that are eligible for fast
track designation are also likely to be considered appropriate to receive a priority review. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:8%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">In addition, products studied for their
safety and effectiveness in treating serious or life-threatening illnesses and that provide meaningful therapeutic benefit over existing treatments may receive accelerated approval and may be approved on the basis of

adequate and well-controlled clinical trials establishing that the drug product has an effect on a surrogate endpoint that is reasonably likely to predict clinical benefit, or on a clinical
endpoint that can be measured earlier than irreversible morbidity or mortality, that is reasonably likely to predict an effect on irreversible morbidity or mortality or other clinical benefit, taking into account the severity, rarity or prevalence
of the condition and the availability or lack of alternative treatments. As a condition of approval, the FDA may require a sponsor of a drug receiving accelerated approval to perform post-marketing studies to verify and describe the predicted effect
on irreversible morbidity or mortality or other clinical endpoint, and the drug may be subject to accelerated withdrawal procedures. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:8%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Moreover, under the provisions of the new Food and Drug Administration Safety and Innovation Act, or FDASIA, enacted in 2012, a sponsor can
request designation of a product candidate as a &#147;breakthrough therapy.&#148; A breakthrough therapy is defined as a drug that is intended, alone or in combination with one or more other drugs, to treat a serious or life-threatening disease or
condition, and preliminary clinical evidence indicates that the drug may demonstrate substantial improvement over existing therapies on one or more clinically significant endpoints, such as substantial treatment effects observed early in clinical
development. Drugs designated as breakthrough therapies are also eligible for accelerated approval. The FDA must take certain actions, such as holding timely meetings and providing advice, intended to expedite the development and review of an
application for approval of a breakthrough therapy. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:8%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Even if a product qualifies for one or more of these programs, the FDA may later
decide that the product no longer meets the conditions for qualification or decide that the time period for FDA review or approval will not be shortened. We believe that we may qualify for one or more of these expedited approvals since our
itraconazole anti-cancer therapies offer significant improvements in therapy for all of our targeted anti-cancer indications should they be approved by FDA. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:8%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><I>Post-Approval Requirements.</I> Drugs manufactured or distributed pursuant to FDA approvals are subject to pervasive and continuing
regulation by the FDA, including, among other things, requirements relating to recordkeeping, periodic reporting, product sampling and distribution, advertising and promotion and reporting of adverse experiences with the product. After approval,
most changes to the approved product, such as adding new indications or other labeling claims are subject to prior FDA review and approval. There also are continuing, annual user fee requirements for any marketed products and the establishments at
which such products are manufactured, as well as new application fees for supplemental applications with clinical data. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:8%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The FDA may
impose a number of post-approval requirements as a condition of approval of an NDA. For example, the FDA may require post-marketing testing, including Phase IV clinical trials and surveillance to further assess and monitor the product&#146;s safety
and effectiveness after commercialization. In addition, drug manufacturers and other entities involved in the manufacture and distribution of approved drugs are required to register their establishments with the FDA and state agencies, and are
subject to periodic unannounced inspections by the FDA and these state agencies for compliance with cGMP requirements. Changes to the manufacturing process are strictly regulated and often require prior FDA approval before being implemented. FDA
regulations also require investigation and correction of any deviations from cGMP and impose reporting and documentation requirements upon the sponsor and any third party manufacturers that the sponsor may decide to use. Accordingly, manufacturers
must continue to expend time, money and effort in the area of production and quality control to maintain cGMP compliance. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:8%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Once an
approval is granted, the FDA may withdraw the approval if compliance with regulatory requirements and standards is not maintained or if problems occur after the product reaches the market. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:8%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Later discovery of previously unknown problems with a product, including adverse events of unanticipated severity or frequency, or with
manufacturing processes, or failure to comply with regulatory requirements, may result in mandatory revisions to the approved labeling to add new safety information; imposition of post-market studies or clinical trials to assess new safety risks; or
imposition of distribution or other restrictions under a REMS program. Other potential consequences include, among other things: </P> <P STYLE="font-size:6pt;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt">&nbsp;</P>

companies generally are required to promote their drug products only for the approved indications and in accordance with the provisions of the approved label. The FDA and other agencies actively
enforce the laws and regulations prohibiting the promotion of off-label uses, and a company that is found to have improperly promoted off-label uses may be subject to significant liability. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:8%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">In addition, the distribution of prescription pharmaceutical products is subject to the Prescription Drug Marketing Act (or PDMA), which
regulates the distribution of drugs and drug samples at the federal level, and sets minimum standards for the registration and regulation of drug distributors by the states. Both the PDMA and state laws limit the distribution of prescription
pharmaceutical product samples and impose requirements to ensure accountability in distribution. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:8%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><I>Federal and State Fraud and Abuse and
Data Privacy and Security Laws and Regulations.</I> In addition to FDA restrictions on marketing of pharmaceutical products, federal and state fraud and abuse laws restrict business practices in the biopharmaceutical industry. These laws include
anti-kickback and false claims laws and regulations as well as data privacy and security laws and regulations. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:8%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The federal Anti-Kickback
Statute prohibits, among other things, knowingly and willfully offering, paying, soliciting or receiving remuneration to induce or in return for purchasing, leasing, ordering, or arranging for or recommending the purchase, lease, or order of any
item or service reimbursable under Medicare, Medicaid or other federal healthcare programs. The term &#147;remuneration&#148; has been broadly interpreted to include anything of value. The Anti-Kickback Statute has been interpreted to apply to
arrangements between pharmaceutical manufacturers on one hand and prescribers, purchasers, and formulary managers on the other. Although there are a number of statutory exemptions and regulatory safe harbors protecting some common activities from
prosecution, the exemptions and safe harbors are drawn narrowly. Practices that involve remuneration that may be alleged to be intended to induce prescribing, purchases, or recommendations may be subject to scrutiny if they do not qualify for an
exemption or safe harbor. Several courts have interpreted the statute&#146;s intent requirement to mean that if any one purpose of an arrangement involving remuneration is to induce referrals of federal healthcare covered business, the statute has
been violated. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:8%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The reach of the Anti-Kickback Statute was also broadened by the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act of 2010, as
amended by the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010 (or collectively PPACA), which, among other things, amended the intent requirement of the federal Anti-Kickback Statute such that a person or entity no longer needs to have actual
knowledge of this statute or specific intent to violate it in order to have committed a violation. In addition, PPACA provides that the government may assert that a claim including items or services resulting from a violation of the federal
Anti-Kickback Statute constitutes a false or fraudulent claim for purposes of the civil False Claims Act or the civil monetary penalties statute, which imposes penalties against any person who is determined to have presented or caused to be
presented a claim to a federal health program that the person knows or should know is for an item or service that was not provided as claimed or is false or fraudulent. PPACA also created new federal requirements for reporting, by applicable
manufacturers of covered drugs, payments and other transfers of value to physicians and teaching hospitals. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:8%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The federal False Claims Act
prohibits any person from knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented, a false claim for payment to the federal government or knowingly making, using, or causing to be made or used a false record or statement material to a false or fraudulent
claim to the federal government. A claim includes &#147;any request or demand&#148; for money or property presented to the U.S. government. Several pharmaceutical and other healthcare companies have been prosecuted under these laws for allegedly
providing free product to customers with the expectation that the customers would bill federal programs for the product. Other companies have been prosecuted for causing false claims to be submitted because of the companies&#146; marketing of
products for unapproved, and thus non-reimbursable, uses. The federal Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (or HIPAA) created new federal criminal statutes that prohibit knowingly and willfully executing a scheme to defraud
any healthcare benefit program, including private third party payors and knowingly and willfully falsifying, concealing or covering up a material fact or making any materially false, fictitious or fraudulent statement in connection with the delivery
of or payment for healthcare benefits, items or services. Also, many states have similar fraud and abuse statutes or regulations that apply to items and services reimbursed under Medicaid and other state programs, or, in several states, apply
regardless of the payor. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:8%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">In addition, we may be subject to data privacy and security regulation by both the federal government and the
states in which we conduct our business. HIPAA, as amended by the Health Information Technology and Clinical Health Act (or HITECH) and its implementing regulations, imposes specified requirements relating to the privacy, security and transmission
of individually identifiable health information. Among other things, HITECH makes HIPAA&#146;s privacy and security standards directly applicable to &#147;business associates,&#148; defined as independent contractors or agents of covered entities
that receive or obtain protected health information in connection with providing a service on behalf of a covered entity. HITECH also increased the civil and criminal penalties that may be imposed against covered entities, business associates and
possibly other persons, and gave state attorneys general new authority to file civil actions for damages or injunctions in federal courts to enforce the federal HIPAA laws and seek attorney&#146;s fees and costs associated with pursuing federal
civil actions. In addition, state laws govern the privacy and security of health information in certain circumstances, many of which differ from each other in significant ways and may not have the same effect, thus complicating compliance efforts.

ability to commercialize any approved product candidate will depend in part on the extent to which governmental authorities, private health insurers and other third party payors provide coverage for and establish adequate reimbursement levels for
our therapeutic product candidates and related companion diagnostics. Government health administration authorities, private health insurers and other organizations generally decide which drugs they will pay for and establish reimbursement levels for
healthcare. In particular, in the United States, private health insurers and other third party payors often provide reimbursement for products and services based on the level at which the government (through the Medicare or Medicaid programs)
provides reimbursement for such treatments. In the United States, government authorities and third party payors are increasingly attempting to limit or regulate the price of medical products and services, particularly for new and innovative products
and therapies, which often has resulted in average selling prices lower than they would otherwise be. Further, the increased emphasis on managed healthcare in the United States will put additional pressure on product pricing, reimbursement and
usage, which may adversely affect our future product sales and results of operations. These pressures can arise from rules and practices of managed care groups, judicial decisions and governmental laws and regulations related to Medicare, Medicaid
and healthcare reform, pharmaceutical reimbursement policies and pricing in general. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:8%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Third party payors are increasingly imposing
additional requirements and restrictions on coverage and limiting reimbursement levels for medical products. For example, federal and state governments reimburse covered prescription drugs at varying rates generally below average wholesale price.
These restrictions and limitations influence the purchase of healthcare services and products. Legislative proposals to reform healthcare or reduce costs under government insurance programs may result in lower reimbursement for our products and

of 2003 (or MMA) imposed new requirements for the distribution and pricing of prescription drugs for Medicare beneficiaries. Under Part D, Medicare beneficiaries may enroll in prescription drug plans offered by private entities that provide coverage
of outpatient prescription drugs. Part D plans include both standalone prescription drug benefit plans and prescription drug coverage as a supplement to Medicare Advantage plans. Unlike Medicare Part A and B, Part D coverage is not standardized.
Part D prescription drug plan sponsors are not required to pay for all covered Part D drugs, and each drug plan can develop its own drug formulary that identifies which drugs it will cover and at what tier or level. However, Part D prescription drug
formularies must include drugs within each therapeutic category and class of covered Part D drugs, though not necessarily all the drugs in each category or class. Any formulary used by a Part D prescription drug plan must be developed and reviewed
by a pharmacy and therapeutic committee. Government payment for some of the costs of prescription drugs may increase demand for any products for which we receive marketing approval. However, any negotiated prices for our future products covered by a
Part D prescription drug plan will likely be lower than the prices we might otherwise obtain. Moreover, while the MMA applies only to drug benefits for Medicare beneficiaries, private payors often follow Medicare coverage policy and payment
limitations in setting their own payment rates. Any reduction in payment that results from Medicare Part D may result in a similar reduction in payments from non-governmental payors. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:8%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 provides funding for the federal government to compare the effectiveness of different
treatments for the same illness. A plan for the research will be developed by the Department of Health and Human Services, the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality and the National Institutes for Health, and periodic reports on the status of
the research and related expenditures will be made to Congress. Although the results of the comparative effectiveness studies are not intended to mandate coverage policies for public or private payors, it is not clear what effect, if any, the
research will have on the sales of any product, if any such product or the condition that it is intended to treat is the subject of a study. It is also possible that comparative effectiveness research demonstrating benefits in a competitor&#146;s
product could adversely affect the sales of our product candidates. If third party payors do not consider our product candidates to be cost-effective compared to other available therapies, they may not cover our product candidates, once approved, as
a benefit under their plans or, if they do, the level of payment may not be sufficient to allow us to sell our products on a profitable basis. </P>

system in ways that could affect our ability to sell our products profitably. Among policy makers and payors in the United States and elsewhere, there is significant interest in promoting changes in healthcare systems with the stated goals of
containing healthcare costs, improving quality and expanding access. In the United States, the pharmaceutical industry has been a particular focus of these efforts and has been significantly affected by major legislative initiatives, including, most
recently, PPACA, which became law in March 2010 and substantially changes the way healthcare is financed by both governmental and private insurers. Among other cost containment measures, the PPACA establishes an annual, nondeductible fee on any
entity that manufactures or imports specified branded prescription drugs and biologic agents; a new Medicare Part D coverage gap discount program; and a new formula that increases the rebates a manufacturer must pay under the Medicaid Drug Rebate

list with the FDA each patent with claims that cover the applicant&#146;s product or a method of using the product. Upon approval of a drug, each of the patents listed in the application for the drug is then published in the FDA&#146;s Approved Drug
Products with Therapeutic Equivalence Evaluations, commonly known as the Orange Book. Drugs listed in the Orange Book can, in turn, be cited by potential competitors in support of approval of an abbreviated new drug application, or ANDA, or

dosage form and route of administration as the listed drug and has been shown to be bioequivalent through <I>in vitro</I> or <I>in vivo</I> testing or otherwise to the listed drug. ANDA applicants are not required to conduct or submit results of
preclinical or clinical tests to prove the safety or effectiveness of their drug product, other than the requirement for bioequivalence testing. Drugs approved in this way are commonly referred to as &#147;generic equivalents&#148; to the listed
drug, and can often be substituted by pharmacists under prescriptions written for the original listed drug. 505(b)(2) NDAs generally are submitted for changes to a previously approved drug product, such as a new dosage form or indication. The

challenges a listed drug. A certification that the proposed product will not infringe the already approved product&#146;s listed patents or that such patents are invalid or unenforceable is called a Paragraph&nbsp;IV certification. If the applicant

Paragraph&nbsp;IV certification to the NDA and patent holders once the application has been accepted for filing by the FDA. The NDA and patent holders may then initiate a patent infringement lawsuit in response to the notice of the Paragraph&nbsp;IV
certification. The filing of a patent infringement lawsuit within 45&nbsp;days after the receipt of notice of the Paragraph&nbsp;IV certification automatically prevents the FDA from approving the ANDA or 505(b)(2) NDA until the earlier of
30&nbsp;months, expiration of the patent, settlement of the lawsuit or a decision in the infringement case that is favorable to the ANDA applicant. </P>

chemical entity if the FDA has not previously approved any other new drug containing the same active moiety, which is the molecule or ion responsible for the activity of the drug substance. During the exclusivity period, the FDA may not accept for
review an ANDA or a 505(b)(2) NDA submitted by another company that contains the previously approved active moiety. However, an ANDA or 505(b)(2) NDA may be submitted after four years if it contains a certification of patent invalidity or

submission or approval of a full NDA; however, an applicant submitting a full NDA would be required to conduct or obtain a right of reference to all of the preclinical studies and adequate and well-controlled clinical trials necessary to demonstrate
safety and effectiveness. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:8%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><I>Orphan Drug Exclusivity.</I> The Orphan Drug Act provides incentives for the development of drugs intended
to treat rare diseases or conditions, which generally are diseases or conditions affecting less than 200,000 individuals annually in the United States. If a sponsor demonstrates that a drug is intended to treat a rare disease or condition, the FDA
grants orphan drug designation to the product for that use. The benefits of orphan drug designation include research and development tax credits and exemption from user fees. A drug that is approved for the orphan drug designated indication is
granted seven years of orphan drug exclusivity. During that period, the FDA generally may not approve any other application for the same product for the same indication, although there are exceptions, most notably when the later product is shown to
be clinically superior to the product with exclusivity. We have begun the process to seek orphan drug designation and exclusivity for our product candidate to include treatment of basal cell carcinoma in patients with Gorlin syndrome and may, in the
future, apply for orphan drug indication for stage IV non-squamous, non-small cell lung cancer. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:18pt; margin-bottom:0pt; margin-left:8%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><I>Foreign Regulation </I></P>

either directly or in conjunction with a marketing partner. In order to market any product outside of the United States, we would need to comply with numerous and varying regulatory requirements of other countries regarding safety and efficacy and
governing, among other things, clinical trials, marketing authorization, commercial sales and distribution of our products. This would be the responsibility of one or more of our potential marketing partners. We do however intend to include sites
outside the United States for our clinical trials in order to be able to recruit more patients for testing at a greater number of locations and in less time than if we were to focus only on US-based sites. For example, in the European Union, we
would need to obtain authorization of a clinical trial application (or CTA) in each member state in which we intend to conduct a clinical trial. Whether or not we obtain FDA approval for a product, we would need to obtain the necessary approvals by
the comparable regulatory authorities of foreign countries before we can commence clinical trials or marketing of the product in those countries. The approval process varies from country to country and can involve additional product testing and
additional administrative review periods. The time required to obtain approval in other countries might differ from and be longer than that required to obtain FDA approval. Regulatory approval in one country does not ensure regulatory approval in
another, but a failure or delay in obtaining regulatory approval in one country may negatively impact the regulatory process in others. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:18pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B>Employees

(as described in further detail in the section entitled &#147;Certain Relationships and Related Party Transactions&#148;), Mayne Pharma and its affiliates have been granted a right of first refusal to purchase a pro rata share of any new securities
issued by us, which pro rata share would be determined based upon the number of shares of our common stock held by Mayne Pharma and its affiliates on a fully diluted basis as compared to the number of shares of common stock outstanding immediately
prior to the offering of the new securities on a fully diluted basis. The existence of such right of participation, or the exercise of such rights, may deter potential investors from providing us needed financing, or may deter investment banks from

sold by the individual account of our current President and Chief Executive Officer and Executive Chairman. In addition to Mayne Pharma&#146;s current common stock ownership, Mayne Pharma also has the right to designate one director to our Board of
Directors (and to designate a second director if the size of the Board of Directors is increased to seven directors) until the earlier to occur of: (i)&nbsp;the date that the Supply and License Agreement is terminated or expires, or (ii)&nbsp;the
date on which Mayne Pharma along with its affiliates ceases to own ten percent (10%)&nbsp;or more of our issued and outstanding common stock on a fully diluted basis. During this time frame, Mayne Pharma, through its representative on the Board of
Directors, holds a veto right in the event that we want to increase or decrease the size of the Board of Directors or replace or remove our President and Chief Executive Officer and Executive Chairman (such veto right being the result of each of the
foregoing Board of Director actions requiring the unanimous consent of the Board of Directors). Mayne Pharma&#146;s significant ownership of our common stock plus the existence of these additional rights will for the foreseeable future enable Mayne
Pharma to exert influence over our company and matters requiring stockholder approval including the election of directors, financing activities or a merger or sale of our assets. Additionally, these rights may limit the ability of our Board of
Directors and our management team to make necessary personnel decisions, including adding independent directors to our Board of Directors, which may adversely affect the management of our company, particularly if disputes arise between us and Mayne
Pharma (which disputes in and of themselves could have a material adverse effect on our ability to conduct business). </P>

conflicts of interest may not be resolved in our favor. We do presently have an executive chairman agreement and an employment agreement with Dr.&nbsp;O&#146;Donnell and Mr.&nbsp;Virca, respectively. However, the agreements are terminable upon 60

operated privately. In addition, although our predecessor, CBI, was a company that filed public reports with the SEC, the business of CBI effectively ceased concurrently with its entry into federal bankruptcy proceedings in 2011. As a consequence,
our current business has no historical nexus to that of CBI&#146;s. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">As a public company, we are subject to the reporting requirements of
the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (which we refer to herein as the Exchange Act), the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, the Dodd-Frank Act and other applicable securities rules and regulations. Compliance with these rules and regulations will
increase our legal and financial compliance costs, make some activities (including activities previously undertaken in a private company context) more difficult, time-consuming or costly and increase demand on our systems and resources. The
Sarbanes-Oxley Act requires, among other things, that we maintain effective disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting. In order to maintain and, if required, improve our disclosure controls and procedures and
internal control over financial reporting to meet this standard, significant resources and management oversight may be required. As a result, management&#146;s attention may be diverted from other business concerns, which could adversely affect our
ability to implement our business plans. We may need to hire more employees in the future or engage outside consultants to comply with these requirements, which will increase our costs and expenses. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">In addition, changing laws, regulations and standards relating to corporate governance and public disclosure are creating uncertainty for
public companies, increasing legal and financial compliance costs and making some activities more time consuming. These laws, regulations and standards are subject to varying interpretations, in many cases due to their lack of specificity, and, as a
result, their application in practice may evolve over time as new guidance is provided by regulatory and governing bodies. This could result in continuing uncertainty regarding compliance matters and higher costs necessitated by ongoing revisions to
disclosure and governance practices. We intend to invest resources to comply with evolving laws, regulations and standards, and this investment may result in increased general and administrative expenses and a diversion of management&#146;s time and
attention from business development activities to compliance activities. If our efforts to comply with new laws, regulations and standards differ from the activities intended by regulatory or governing bodies due to ambiguities related to their
application and practice, regulatory authorities may initiate legal proceedings against us and our business may be adversely affected. </P>

interruptions in our operations, and could result in a material disruption of our commercialization activities, development programs and our business operations, in addition to possibly requiring substantial expenditures of resources to remedy. The
loss of clinical trial data from future clinical trials could result in delays in our regulatory approval efforts and significantly increase our costs to recover or reproduce the data. To the extent that any disruption or security breach were to
result in a loss of, or damage to, our data or applications, or inappropriate disclosure of confidential or proprietary information, we could incur liability and the commercialization of any potential product candidate could be delayed. </P>

itraconazole as a cancer therapy, we must conduct extensive clinical trials to demonstrate the safety and efficacy of our product candidate in humans. Clinical testing is expensive, difficult to design and implement, can take many years to complete

our assessment of the collaborator&#146;s resources and expertise, the terms and conditions of the proposed collaboration and the proposed collaborator&#146;s evaluation of a number of factors. If we are unable to maintain or reach agreements with
suitable collaborators on a timely basis, on acceptable terms, or at all, we may have to curtail the development of our product candidate, reduce or delay its development program, delay its potential commercialization or reduce the scope of any
sales or marketing activities, or increase our expenditures and undertake development or commercialization activities at our own expense. </P>

<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Our ability to commercialize any product candidate also will depend in part on the extent to which coverage and adequate reimbursement for our
product candidate will be available from government health administration authorities, private health insurers and other organizations. Government authorities and third party payors, such as private health insurers and health maintenance
organizations, decide which medications they will pay for and establish reimbursement levels. A primary trend in the U.S. healthcare industry and elsewhere is cost containment. Government authorities and third party payors have attempted to control
costs by limiting coverage and the amount of reimbursement for particular medications. Increasingly, third party payors are requiring that drug companies provide them with predetermined discounts from list prices and are challenging the prices
charged for medical products. Coverage and reimbursement may not be available for any product that we commercialize and, even if these are available, the level of reimbursement may not be satisfactory. Reimbursement may affect the demand for, or the
price of, any product candidate for which we obtain marketing approval. Obtaining and maintaining adequate reimbursement for our products may be difficult. We may be required to conduct expensive pharmacoeconomic studies to justify coverage and
reimbursement or the level of reimbursement relative to other therapies. If coverage and adequate reimbursement are not available or reimbursement is available only to limited levels, we may not be able to commercialize any product candidate for
which we obtain marketing approval. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">In addition, there may be significant delays in obtaining reimbursement for newly approved drugs, and
coverage may be more limited than the purposes for which the drug is approved by the FDA. Moreover, eligibility for reimbursement does not imply that a drug will be paid for in all cases or at a rate that covers our costs, including research,
development, manufacture, sale and distribution. Interim reimbursement levels for new drugs, if applicable, may also not be sufficient to cover our costs and may not be made permanent. Reimbursement rates may vary according to the use of the drug
and the clinical setting in which it is used, may be based on reimbursement levels already set for lower cost drugs and may be incorporated into existing payments for other services. Net prices for drugs may be reduced by mandatory discounts or
rebates required by government healthcare programs or private payors. Third party payors often rely upon Medicare coverage policy and payment limitations in setting their own reimbursement policies. Our inability to promptly obtain coverage and
adequate reimbursement rates from both government-funded and private payors for any approved products that we develop could have a material adverse effect on our operating results, our ability to raise capital needed to commercialize products and
our overall financial condition. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B><I>Product liability lawsuits against us could cause us to incur substantial liabilities and to limit

product-related liabilities that we may incur. We may be unable to obtain insurance on reasonable terms or at all. Insurance coverage is increasingly expensive. We may not be able to maintain insurance coverage at a reasonable cost or in an amount

<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B><I>If we are unable to obtain and maintain patent protection for our technology and products (particularly itraconazole, and the
formulation of SUBA-Itraconazole in particular, as an anti-cancer therapy), or if the scope of the patent protection obtained is not sufficiently broad, our competitors could develop and commercialize technology and products similar or identical to
ours, and our ability to commercialize our technology and products may be impaired. </I></B></P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Our business plan depends in large part on
our ability to obtain and maintain patent protection in the United States with respect to our proprietary technology and products, and in particular, the rights to develop SUBA-Itraconazole as an anti-cancer therapy. We seek to protect our
proprietary position through our exclusive license for SUBA-Itraconazole with Mayne Pharma, through our expected sublicense of other itraconazole-related rights from Mayne Pharma, and by filing patent applications in the United States related to our
novel technologies and product candidate and also expect to license additional applicable patents from third parties. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The patent
prosecution process is expensive and time-consuming, and we may not be able to file and prosecute all necessary or desirable patent applications at a reasonable cost or in a timely manner. It is also possible that we will fail to identify patentable
aspects of our research and development output before it is too late to obtain patent protection. Moreover, in some circumstances (particularly in collaboration scenarios such as our agreement with Mayne Pharma), we may not have the right to control
(in whole or in part) the preparation, filing and prosecution of patent applications, or to maintain the patents, covering technology that we license from third parties. Therefore, these patents and applications may not be prosecuted and enforced in
a manner consistent with the best interests of our business. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The patent position of biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies generally
is highly uncertain, involves complex legal and factual questions and has in recent years been the subject of much litigation. In addition, the laws of foreign countries may not protect our rights to the same extent as the laws of the United States.
For example, European patent law restricts the patentability of methods of treatment of the human body more than United States law does. Publications of discoveries in the scientific literature often lag behind the actual discoveries, and patent
applications in the United States and other jurisdictions are typically not published until 18 months after filing, or in some cases not at all. Therefore, we cannot know with certainty whether we were the first to make the inventions claimed in our
owned or licensed patents or pending patent applications, or that we were the first to file for patent protection of such inventions. As a result, the issuance, scope, validity, enforceability and commercial value of our patent rights are highly
uncertain. Our pending and future patent applications may not result in patents being issued which protect our technology or products, in whole or in part, or which effectively prevent others from commercializing competitive technologies and
products. Changes in either the patent laws or interpretation of the patent laws in the United States and other countries may diminish the value of our patents or narrow the scope of our patent protection. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Patent reform legislation could further increase the uncertainties and costs surrounding the prosecution of our patent applications and the
enforcement or defense of our issued patents. On September&nbsp;16, 2011, the Leahy-Smith America Invents Act, or the Leahy-Smith Act, was signed into law. The Leahy-Smith Act includes a number of significant changes to United States patent law.
These include provisions that affect the way patent applications are prosecuted and may also affect patent litigation. The United States Patent Office has developed regulations and procedures to govern administration of the Leahy-Smith Act, and many
of the substantive changes to patent law associated with the Leahy-Smith Act, and in particular, the first to file provisions, became effective on March&nbsp;16, 2013. Accordingly, since we have patent applications pending and plan to file for
additional patents in the future, it is not clear what, if any, impact the Leahy-Smith Act will have on the operation of our business. However, the Leahy-Smith Act and its implementation could increase the uncertainties and costs surrounding the
prosecution of our patent applications and the enforcement or defense of our issued patents, all of which could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial condition. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Moreover, we may be subject to a third party preissuance submission of prior art to the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office, or become involved
in opposition, derivation, reexamination, <I>inter partes</I> review, post-grant review or interference proceedings challenging our patent rights or the patent rights of others. An adverse determination in any such submission, proceeding or
litigation could reduce the scope of, or invalidate our patent rights, allow third parties to commercialize our technology or products and compete directly with us, without payment to us, or result in our inability to manufacture or commercialize
products without infringing third party patent rights. In addition, if the breadth or strength of protection provided by our patents and patent applications is threatened, it could dissuade companies from collaborating with us to license, develop or
commercialize current or future product candidates. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Even if our owned and licensed patent applications issue as patents, they may not
issue in a form that will provide us with any meaningful protection, prevent competitors from competing with us or otherwise provide us with any competitive advantage. Our competitors may be able to circumvent our owned or licensed patents by
developing similar or alternative technologies or products in a non-infringing manner. </P>

enforceability, and our owned and licensed patents may be challenged in the courts or patent offices in the United States and abroad. Such challenges may result in loss of exclusivity or freedom to operate or in patent claims being narrowed,
invalidated or held unenforceable, in whole or in part, which could limit our ability to stop others from using or commercializing similar or identical technology and products, or limit the duration of the patent protection of our technology and
products. Given the amount of time required for the development, testing and regulatory review of our product candidate, patents protecting such candidate might expire before or shortly after such candidates are commercialized. As a result, our
owned and licensed patent portfolio may not provide us with sufficient rights to exclude others from commercializing products similar or identical to ours. Neither we nor Mayne Pharma has conducted a comprehensive freedom to operate search in the
United States relating to the use of itraconazole in the treatment of cancer, and as a result, patents may in the future be issued, or may already have issued, to third parties that would prevent us from developing SUBA-Itraconazole for our intended
cancer indications. If such patents have issued or are issued in the future, and such patents are determined to be valid, we or Mayne Pharma could be required to obtain a license to such patents in order to allow us to continue the development of
SUBA-Itraconazole for our intended indications. We or Mayne Pharma may be unable to obtain such licenses on reasonable terms or at all. </P>

infringement or unauthorized use, we may be required to file infringement claims, which can be expensive and time consuming. Furthermore, we do not have the right to sue infringers of the rights granted to us by Mayne Pharma under the Supply and
License Agreement, so we will be reliant upon them to take any action necessary to protect these patents. Any claims we assert against perceived infringers could provoke these parties to assert counterclaims against us alleging that we infringe
their patents. In addition, in a patent infringement proceeding, a court may decide that a patent of ours is invalid or unenforceable, in whole or in part, construe the patent&#146;s claims narrowly or refuse to stop the other party from using the
technology at issue on the grounds that our patents do not cover the technology in question. An adverse result in any litigation proceeding could put one or more of our patents at risk of being invalidated or interpreted narrowly. </P>

ability, and the ability of our collaborators, to develop, manufacture, market and sell our product candidates and use our proprietary technologies without infringing the proprietary rights of third parties. There is considerable intellectual
property litigation in the biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries. We may become party to, or threatened with, future adversarial proceedings or litigation regarding intellectual property rights with respect to our primary product candidate or
other products and technology, including interference or derivation proceedings before the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office. Third parties may assert infringement claims against us based on existing patents or patents that may be granted in the

non-exclusive, thereby giving our competitors access to the same technologies licensed to us. We could be forced, including by court order, to cease commercializing the infringing technology or product. In addition, we could be found liable for
monetary damages, including treble damages and attorneys&#146; fees if we are found to have willfully infringed a patent. Further, we are obliged under the Supply and License Agreement with Mayne Pharma to indemnify it with respect to any claims,
losses, damages or expenses arising from the research, development, or commercialization of SUBA-Itraconazole and any actual or alleged infringement of third party intellectual property rights. A finding of infringement could prevent us from
commercializing our product candidates or force us to cease some of our business operations, which could materially harm our business. Claims that we have misappropriated the confidential information or trade secrets of third parties could have a
similar negative impact on our business. </P>

commercialization, including matters relating to design, testing, manufacture, safety, efficacy, recordkeeping, labeling, storage, approval, advertising, promotion, sale and distribution, are subject to comprehensive regulation by the FDA (including
under the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act) and other regulatory agencies in the United States. Failure to obtain marketing approval for our product candidate will prevent us from commercializing the product candidate. We have not received
approval to market SUBA-Itraconazole as an anti-cancer therapy or any other product from regulatory authorities in any jurisdiction and it will likely be years before we are even eligible to receive such approval. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Securing marketing approval requires the submission of extensive preclinical and clinical data and supporting information to regulatory
authorities for each therapeutic indication to establish the product candidate&#146;s safety and efficacy. Securing marketing approval also requires the submission of information about the product manufacturing process to, and inspection of
manufacturing facilities by, the regulatory authorities. Our product candidate may not be effective, may be only moderately effective or may prove to have undesirable or unintended side effects, toxicities or other characteristics that may preclude
us from obtaining marketing approval or prevent or limit commercial use of our product. In particular, new cancer drugs frequently are indicated only for patient populations that have not responded to an existing therapy or have relapsed. Even if
our product candidate receives marketing approval for one or more indications, of which no assurances may be given, the accompanying labels may limit the approved use of our drug, which could limit sales of the product. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The process of obtaining marketing approvals in the United States is very expensive, may take many years, if approval is obtained at all, and
can vary substantially based upon a variety of factors, including the type, complexity and novelty of the product candidate involved. Changes in marketing approval policies during the development period, changes in or the enactment of additional
statutes or regulations, or changes in regulatory review for each submitted product application, may cause delays in the approval or rejection of an application. Regulatory authorities have substantial discretion in the approval process and may

condition, the drug sponsor may apply for FDA fast track designation. The FDA has broad discretion whether or not to grant this designation, so even if we believe that SUBA-Itraconazole as an
anti-cancer therapy may be eligible for this designation, we cannot assure you that the FDA would decide to grant it should we apply for this designation. Even if we do receive fast track designation, we may not experience a faster development
process, review or approval compared to conventional FDA procedures. The FDA may withdraw fast track designation if it believes that the designation is no longer supported by data from our clinical development program. </P>

<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">We may seek a &#147;breakthrough therapy&#148; designation for our product candidate. A breakthrough therapy is defined as a drug that is
intended, alone or in combination with one or more other drugs, to treat a serious or life-threatening disease or condition, and preliminary clinical evidence indicates that the drug may demonstrate substantial improvement over existing therapies on
one or more clinically significant endpoints, such as substantial treatment effects observed early in clinical development. For drugs and biologics that have been designated as breakthrough therapies, interaction and communication between the FDA
and the sponsor of the trial can help to identify the most efficient path for clinical development while minimizing the number of patients placed in ineffective control regimens. Drugs designated as breakthrough therapies by the FDA are also
eligible for accelerated approval. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Designation as a breakthrough therapy is within the discretion of the FDA. Accordingly, even if we
believe that SUBA-Itraconazole as an anti-cancer therapy meets the criteria for designation as a breakthrough therapy for one or more indications, the FDA may disagree and instead determine not to make such designation. Even if such designation is
granted, of which no assurances may be given, the receipt of a breakthrough therapy designation for our product candidate may not result in a faster development process, review or approval compared to drugs considered for approval under conventional
FDA procedures and does not assure ultimate approval by the FDA. In addition, even if SUBA-Itraconazole as an anti-cancer therapy qualifies as a breakthrough therapy for one or more indications, the FDA may later decide that it no longer meets the
conditions for qualification or decide that the time period for FDA review or approval will not be shortened, which would deny us the benefits of such designation. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B><I>We may seek but be unable to obtain orphan drug exclusivity for our product candidate. If our competitors are able to obtain orphan drug
exclusivity for their products that are the same drug as our product candidate, we may not be able to have competing products approved by the applicable regulatory authority for a significant period of time. </I></B></P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Regulatory authorities may designate drugs for relatively small patient populations as orphan drugs. Generally, if a product with an orphan
drug designation subsequently receives the first marketing approval for the indication for which it has such designation, the product is entitled to a period of market exclusivity, which, subject to certain exceptions, precludes the FDA from
approving another marketing application for the same drug for the same indication for that time period. The applicable market exclusivity period is seven years in the United States. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Obtaining orphan drug exclusivity for SUBA-Itraconazole as an anti-cancer therapy may be important to our commercial strategy. If a competitor
obtains orphan drug exclusivity for and approval of a product with the same indication as our itraconazole product before we do, and if the competitor&#146;s product is the same drug or a similar medicinal product as ours, we could be excluded from
the market. Even if we obtain orphan drug exclusivity for SUBA-Itraconazole as an anti-cancer therapy, we may not be able to maintain it. For example, if a competitive product that is the same drug or a similar medicinal product as our product
candidate is shown to be clinically superior to our product candidate, any orphan drug exclusivity we have obtained will not block the approval of such competitive product. In addition, orphan drug exclusivity will not prevent the approval of a
product that is the same drug as our product candidate if the FDA finds that we cannot assure the availability of sufficient quantities of the drug to meet the needs of the persons with the disease or condition for which the drug was designated. If
one or more of these events occur, it could have a material adverse effect on our company. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B><I>Even if we obtain marketing approval for

clinical data, labeling, advertising and promotional activities for such product, we will be subject to continual requirements of and review by the FDA and other regulatory authorities. These requirements include submissions of safety and other
post-marketing information and reports, registration and listing requirements, cGMP requirements relating to manufacturing, quality control, quality assurance and corresponding maintenance of records and documents, requirements regarding the

strategy. New cancer drugs frequently are indicated only for patient populations that have not responded to an existing therapy or have relapsed.&nbsp;If our product candidate receives marketing approval, the accompanying label may limit the
approved use of our drug in this way, which could limit sales of the product. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The FDA may also impose requirements for costly
post-marketing studies or clinical trials and surveillance to monitor the safety or efficacy of our product. The FDA closely regulates the post-approval marketing and promotion of drugs to ensure drugs are marketed only for the approved indications
and in accordance with the provisions of the approved labeling. The FDA imposes stringent restrictions on manufacturers&#146; communications regarding off-label use and if we or any third party partners of ours do not market our products for their
approved indications, we may be subject to enforcement action for off-label marketing. Violations of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act relating to the promotion of prescription drugs may lead to investigations alleging violations of federal

have the effect of delaying, deterring or preventing a change of control or other business combination that might otherwise be beneficial to our stockholders. This significant concentration of share ownership may also adversely affect the trading
price for our common stock because investors may perceive disadvantages in owning stock in a company that is controlled by a small number of stockholders. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B><I>Our Board of Directors has the authority to declare a reverse split of our Common Stock, which could adversely affect our capitalization
and stock price.</I></B> </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">On July&nbsp;18, 2014, our Board of Directors acted unanimously to adopt an amendment to Article FOURTH of our
Certificate of Incorporation to effect a reverse split of our issued and outstanding Common Stock (and, at the sole discretion of the Board of Directors, our authorized Common Stock) at a ratio of between one-for-five and one-for-twenty, with such
ratio to be determined at the sole discretion of the Board of Directors and with such reverse split to be effected at such time and date, if at all, as determined by our board in its sole discretion. On September&nbsp;30, 2014, our majority
stockholders, acting by written consent, approved such amendment and the reverse split. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The principal purpose of the reverse split would
be to help increase the per share market price of our Common Stock by up to a factor of twenty, which could help us with our fundraising efforts. We cannot assure you, however, that the reverse split, if implemented, will accomplish either of these
objectives for any meaningful period of time or at all. While we expect that the reduction in the number of outstanding shares of Common Stock will increase the market price of our Common Stock, we cannot assure you that the reverse split will
increase the market price of our Common Stock by an equivalent multiple, or result in any permanent increase in the market price of our Common Stock. The price of our Common Stock is dependent upon many factors, including our business and financial
performance, general market conditions and prospects for future success. If the per share market price does not increase proportionately as a result of the reverse split, then the value of our company as measured by our stock capitalization will be
reduced, perhaps significantly. Moreover, while it is believed that a higher stock price could assist in our ability to raise capital, there is a risk that these benefits will not be realized. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">In addition, the number of shares held by each individual stockholder would be reduced if the reverse split is implemented. This will increase
the number of stockholders who hold less than a &#147;round lot,&#148; or 100 shares. This would have the disadvantage that the&nbsp;transaction costs to stockholders selling &#147;odd lots&#148; are typically higher on a per share basis.
Consequently, the reverse split could increase the transaction costs to existing stockholders in the event they wish to sell all or a portion of their position. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Also, although it is believed that the decrease in the number of shares of our Common Stock outstanding as a consequence of the reverse split
and the anticipated increase in the market price of our Common Stock could encourage interest in our Common Stock and possibly promote greater liquidity for our stockholders, such liquidity could also be adversely affected by the reduced number of
shares outstanding after the reverse split. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B><I>Future sales of our common stock in the public market could lower the price of our

HPLLC and Mayne Pharma, and these entities also hold warrants to purchase our common stock. Future sales of a substantial number of shares of our common stock in the public market, or the perception that such sales may occur, could adversely affect
the then prevailing market price of our common stock and could make it more difficult for us to raise funds in the future through a public offering of our securities. </P>

be a &#147;penny stock&#148; if it meets one or more of the following conditions: (i)&nbsp;the stock trades at a price less than $5 per share; (ii)&nbsp;it is not traded on a &#147;recognized&#148; national exchange; or (iii)&nbsp;is issued by a
company (such as ours) that has been in business less than three years with net tangible assets less than $5 million. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The principal
result or effect of being designated a &#147;penny stock&#148; is that securities broker-dealers participating in sales of our common stock will be subject to the &#147;penny stock&#148; regulations set forth in Rules 15g-2 through 15g-9 promulgated
under the Exchange Act. For example, Rule 15g-2 requires broker-dealers dealing in penny stocks to provide potential investors with a document disclosing the risks of penny stocks and to obtain a manually signed and dated written receipt of the
document at least two business days before effecting any transaction in a penny stock for the investor&#146;s account. Moreover, Rule 15g-9 requires broker-dealers in penny stocks to approve the account of any investor for transactions in such
stocks before selling any penny stock to that investor. This procedure requires the broker-dealer to: (i)&nbsp;obtain from the investor information concerning his or her financial situation, investment experience and investment objectives;
(ii)&nbsp;reasonably determine, based on that information, that transactions in penny stocks are suitable for the investor and that the investor has sufficient knowledge and experience as to be reasonably capable of evaluating the risks of penny
stock transactions; (iii)&nbsp;provide the investor with a written statement setting forth the basis on which the broker-dealer made the determination in (ii)&nbsp;above; and (iv)&nbsp;receive a signed and dated copy of such statement from the
investor, confirming that it accurately reflects the investor&#146;s financial situation, investment experience and investment objectives. Compliance with these requirements may make it more difficult and time consuming for holders of our common
stock to resell their shares to third parties or to otherwise dispose of them in the market or otherwise. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B><I>FINRA sales practice

rules require broker-dealers to have reasonable grounds for believing that an investment is suitable for a customer before recommending that investment to the customer. Prior to recommending speculative low-priced securities to their
non-institutional customers, broker-dealers must make reasonable efforts to obtain information about the customer&#146;s financial status, tax status and investment objectives, among other things. Under interpretations of these rules, FINRA believes
that there is a high probability such speculative low-priced securities will not be suitable for at least some customers. Thus, FINRA requirements make it more difficult for broker-dealers to recommend that their customers buy our common stock,
which may limit your ability to buy and sell our shares, have an adverse effect on the market for our shares, and thereby depress our share price. </P>

<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Each state has its own securities laws, often called &#147;blue sky&#148; laws, which (1)&nbsp;limit sales of securities to a state&#146;s
residents unless the securities are registered in that state or qualify for an exemption from registration, and (2)&nbsp;govern the reporting requirements for broker-dealers doing business directly or indirectly in the state. Before a security is
sold in a state, there must be a registration in place to cover the transaction, or it must be exempt from registration. The applicable broker-dealer must also be registered in that state. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">We do not know whether our securities will be registered or exempt from registration under the laws of any state. A determination regarding
registration will be made by those broker-dealers, if any, who agree to serve as market makers for our common stock. We have not yet applied to have our securities registered in any state and will not do so until we receive expressions of interest
from investors resident in specific states after they have viewed this Report. There may be significant state blue sky law restrictions on the ability of investors to sell, and on purchasers to buy, our securities. You should therefore consider the
resale market for our common stock to be limited, as you may be unable to resell your shares without the significant expense of state registration or qualification. </P>

our control systems to prevent error or fraud could materially and adversely impact us. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B><I>Because we became public by means other

<P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">In October 2012, Andrew Chien (&#147;Chien&#148;), an alleged shareholder of our predecessor, CBI, filed suit in Connecticut state court (later
removed to the United States District Court for the District of Connecticut (the &#147;CT District Court&#148;)) against CBI, Dr.&nbsp;Richard&nbsp;J. Freer (a director and officer of CBI) (&#147;Freer&#148;), and the law firm LeClairRyan (the
&#147;Chien Connecticut Case&#148;). </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">In October 2012, the CT District Court in the Chien Connecticut Case entered an Order dismissing
Chien&#146;s claims without prejudice on account of CBI&#146;s pending Chapter 11 bankruptcy. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Chien filed various motions in response to
the CT District Court&#146;s decision dismissing the claims asserted against Freer and LeClairRyan, including a motion for reconsideration. On Thursday, May&nbsp;29, 2014, the presiding judge issued several orders. The CT District Court granted
Chien&#146;s request that he be allowed to proceed with the fifth and six claims he asserted against CBI in his Complaint, namely (i)&nbsp;a claim for relief entitled &#147;Securities Fraud and Fiduciary Duty Violation against CBI&#148; and
(ii)&nbsp;a claim for relief entitled &#147;Fiduciary Duty violation against CBI&#148; (collectively, the &#147;Chien Claims&#148;). A related scheduling order provided that CBI had until June&nbsp;20, 2014 to answer or otherwise respond to the
Complaint. We have retained LeClairRyan to serve as CBI&#146;s counsel in the Chien Connecticut Case. On June&nbsp;20, 2014, LeClairRyan filed on CBI&#146;s behalf a motion to dismiss seeking a dismissal with prejudice of the Chien Claims.
LeClairRyan also filed on CBI&#146;s behalf a motion to stay discovery. On August&nbsp;5, 2014, the CT District Court granted CBI&#146;s motion to stay discovery. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">On November&nbsp;4, 2014, the CT District Court dismissed the case and the matter was closed by the court. On December&nbsp;1, 2014, Chien filed various
motions including a Motion to Reargue. In response, we filed a consolidated opposition to Chien&#146;s various pleadings, including to the Motion to Reargue. We are now awaiting a decision from the Court. We strongly refute as without merit
Chien&#146;s claims and will continue to vigorously defend the lawsuit. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:18pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><I>Chien Virginia Case </I></P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">In April 2013, Chien filed an adversary proceeding to recover monetary and injunctive relief against CBI and Freer in the United States
Bankruptcy Court for the Eastern District of Virginia (the &#147;EDVA Bankruptcy Court&#148;). On June&nbsp;19, 2013, the EDVA Bankruptcy Court held a hearing on CBI&#146;s and Freer&#146;s motions to strike and / or dismiss Chien&#146;s adversary
proceeding Complaint. At the conclusion of the June&nbsp;19, 2013 hearing the EDVA Bankruptcy Court granted CBI&#146;s and Freer&#146;s motions to strike and / or dismiss and ordered that Chien&#146;s adversary proceeding be dismissed. On
July&nbsp;1, 2013, the EDVA Bankruptcy Court entered a Memorandum Opinion memorializing its decision. Chien perfected an appeal of the EDVA Bankruptcy Court&#146;s decision (the &#147;Bankruptcy Appeal&#148;) to the United States District Court for

a biopharmaceutical company that is seeking to discover, develop and commercialize innovative therapeutics for patients with certain cancers.&nbsp;Our preliminary focus is on the development of therapies for skin, lung and prostate cancers in the
U.S. market, with the first indication targeting basal cell carcinoma in patients with Gorlin Syndrome, a genetic disease also known as Basal Cell Carcinoma Nevus Syndrome, which, among other conditions, causes the chronic formation of basal cell
tumors. Our proposed therapy is based upon the use of a patented formulation of the currently marketed anti-fungal drug itraconazole. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">We
have developed, licensed and are seeking to acquire and/or license, intellectual property and know-how related to the treatment of cancer patients using itraconazole and have applied for patents to cover our inventions. We have exclusive rights in
the U.S. to develop and to commercialize a specially formulated, patented version of itraconazole, known as SUBA-Itraconazole Capsules, for the treatment of human cancer via oral administration. SUBA-Itraconazole was developed and is licensed to us
by our manufacturing partner Mayne Pharma. We believe that the dosing of oral capsules of SUBA-Itraconazole can affect the Hedgehog signaling pathway, a major regulator of many fundamental cellular processes, which, in turn, can impact the
development and growth of cancer such as basal cell carcinoma. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">We were founded under the name &#147;Commonwealth Biotechnologies,
Inc.&#148; in Virginia in 1992, and completed an initial public offering in October 1997. CBI previously provided, on a contract basis, specialized life sciences services to the pharmaceutical and biotechnology sector. On January&nbsp;20, 2011, CBI
filed a voluntary petition for bankruptcy. We began our current business in August 2013 as a Delaware corporation following the emergence of CBI from its voluntary bankruptcy proceedings. </P>

<P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">We account for stock-based awards to employees and non-employees using Financial Accounting Standards Board (&#147;FASB&#148;) Accounting
Standards Codification (&#147;ASC&#148;) Topic 718 &#150; Accounting for Share-Based Payments, which provides for the use of the fair value based method to determine compensation for all arrangements where shares of stock or equity instruments are
issued for compensation. Fair values of equity securities issued are determined by management based predominantly on the trading price of our common stock. The value of these awards is based upon their grant-date fair value. That cost is recognized
over the period during which the employee is required to provide service in exchange for the award. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:18pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><I>Income taxes </I></P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for future tax consequences attributed to differences between the consolidated financial
statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases and are measured using enacted tax rates that are expected to apply to the differences in the periods that they are expected to reverse. We have evaluated
the guidance relating to accounting for uncertainty in income taxes and determined that we had no uncertain income tax positions that could have a significant effect on the consolidated financial statements for the years ended December&nbsp;31, 2014
or 2013. Deferred tax assets consists primarily of in-process research and development, net operating loss carryforward, and share-based compensation. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:18pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><I>Accounting for Enterprises in Reorganization </I></P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">FASB ASC Topic 852&#151;<I>Reorganizations </I>(&#147;ASC Topic 852&#148;), which is applicable to companies in Chapter 11, generally does not
change the manner in which financial statements are prepared. However, it does require that the financial statements for periods subsequent to the filing of the Chapter 11 petition distinguish transactions and events that are directly associated
with the reorganization from the ongoing operations of the business. Revenues, expenses, realized gains and losses, and provisions for losses that can be directly associated with the reorganization and restructuring of the business must be reported
separately as reorganization items in the statements of operations beginning in the quarter ending March&nbsp;31, 2011. The balance sheet must distinguish prepetition liabilities subject to compromise from both those prepetition liabilities that are
not subject to compromise and from post-petition liabilities. Liabilities that may be affected by a plan of reorganization must be reported at the amounts expected to be allowed by the Bankruptcy Court, even if they may be settled for lesser
amounts. In addition, cash flows from reorganization items must be disclosed separately in the statement of cash flows. The Company became subject to ASC Topic 852 effective on January&nbsp;20, 2011, and has segregated those items as outlined above
for all reporting periods after such date. The Company officially emerged from bankruptcy on April&nbsp;17, 2013, followed by the reincorporation merger, which satisfied the final condition to effectiveness of the Plan. </P>

ended December&nbsp;31, 2014 and 2013, respectively. For the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2014, research and development expenses consist of approximately $1.9 million of in-process research and development associated with the issuance of common
stock shares and warrants to Mayne Pharma upon entering into our Amended and Restated Supply and License Agreement in June 2014. The balance of the research and development expenses consists primarily of salaries and consulting fees related to
clinical trial design and regulatory activities as well as approximately $0.3 million in stock compensation expense related to research and development activities. For the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2013, research and development expenses
consisted of approximately $1.0 million in in-process research and development purchased with the issuance of the preferred shares to Hedgepath, LLC in August 2013, and salaries related to clinical trial design and regulatory activities. </P>

years ended December&nbsp;31, 2014 and 2013, respectively. General and administrative expenses consist primarily of compensation and related costs for corporate administrative staff, facility expenditures, professional fees, consulting and taxes.
The increase of approximately $0.7 million is primarily a result of the increase in stock compensation expense of $0.5 million during 2014. The increase in stock compensation was a result of the issuance, during 2014, of restricted stock units to
certain employees and Directors under the 2014 Equity Incentive Plan. </P>

insufficient to develop our clinical and regulatory business plan, and we have not generated revenue since emerging from bankruptcy and do not anticipate generating revenue for the foreseeable future. A continued lack of cash resources resulting
from our inability to generate cash flow from operations or to raise capital from external sources would force us in the near future to substantially curtail or cease operations and would, therefore, have a material adverse effect on our business
and overall viability. In addition, such lack of funding, if not agreed otherwise by the parties, could force a termination of our key supply and license agreement with Mayne Pharma, which would cause substantial harm to our business prospects. </P>

Frank E. O&#146;Donnell, Jr. M.D., our Executive Chairman. The complaints allege that the defendants violated federal securities laws by making or causing Accentia and/or Biovest to make false statements, and by failing to disclose or causing
Accentia and/or Biovest to fail to disclose material information, concerning the results of the clinical trial of Biovest&#146;s cancer vaccine, BiovaxID, and status of its approval by the FDA. Plaintiffs seek damages in an unspecified amount on

vigorously defended the alleged claims. A settlement of this matter, in which defendants make no admissions of wrongdoing or liability, has been agreed upon by all parties and approved by the Court. </P>

was approved by the majority of stockholders pending delivery of required notice to all Company stockholders. The EIP is comprised of 32,583,475 shares of our common stock (ranking pari passu with our issued and outstanding common stock) to be
available in the form of incentive stock options, non-qualified stock options, restricted stock, restricted stock units, performance awards and other customary equity incentives. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The purpose of our EIP is to attract and retain directors, officers, consultants, advisors and employees whose services are considered
valuable, to encourage a sense of proprietorship and to stimulate an active interest of such persons in our development and financial achievements. The EIP will be administered by the compensation committee of our Board of Directors or by the full
Board of Directors, which may determine, among other things, (a)&nbsp;the persons who are to receive awards, (b)&nbsp;the type or types of awards to be granted to such persons, (c)&nbsp;the number of shares of common stock to be covered by, or with
respect to which payments, rights, or other matters are to be calculated in connection with the awards, (d)&nbsp;the terms and conditions of any awards, (e)&nbsp;whether, to what extent, and under what circumstances awards may be settled or
exercised in cash, shares of common stock, other securities, other awards or other property, or canceled, forfeited, or suspended and the method or methods by which awards may be settled, exercised, canceled, forfeited, or suspended,
(f)&nbsp;whether, to what extent, and under what circumstances the delivery of cash, shares of common stock, other securities, other awards or other property and other amounts payable with respect to an award, (g)&nbsp;interpret, administer,
reconcile any inconsistency in, settle any controversy regarding, correct any defect in and/or complete any omission in the EIP and any instrument or agreement relating to, or award granted under, the EIP, (h)&nbsp;establish, amend, suspend, or
waive any rules and regulations and appoint such agents as the compensation committee deems appropriate for the proper administration of the EIP, (i)&nbsp;accelerate the vesting or exercisability of, payment for or lapse of restrictions on, awards
and (j)&nbsp;make any other determination and take any other action that the compensation committee deems necessary or desirable for the administration of the EIP. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt;page-break-before:always"></P>

granted pursuant to the EIP will immediately vest and become immediately exercisable as of a time prior to the change in control, (ii)&nbsp;any performance goal restrictions related to an award will expire as of a time prior to the change in control
and (iii)&nbsp;any performance periods that relating to an award which have not yet expired on the date the change in control occurs will end on such date, and the compensation committee will (a)&nbsp;determine the extent to which performance goals
with respect to each such performance period have been met based upon such audited or unaudited financial information or other information then available as it deems relevant and (b)&nbsp;cause the relevant participant to receive partial or full
payment of awards for each such performance period based upon the compensation committee&#146;s determination of the degree of attainment of the performance goals, or assuming that the applicable &#147;target&#148; levels of performance have been

purchase 10,250,569 shares of our common stock. The shares of Series A Preferred Stock converted into 8,784,390 shares of common stock on August&nbsp;14, 2014. Such warrant has an exercise price of $0.0878 per share and may be exercised at any time,
from time to time, by Mayne Pharma prior to the expiration on June&nbsp;24, 2019. As a result of the Mayne Purchase Agreement, Mayne Pharma owns approximately 40% of our equity securities on a fully diluted basis. </P>

<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">To the Board of Directors of HedgePath Pharmaceuticals, Inc. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">We have audited the accompanying balance sheets of HedgePath Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (the &#147;Company&#148;) as of December&nbsp;31, 2014 and 2013 and the
related statements of operations, stockholders&#146; equity (deficit) and cash flows for the years then ended. The Company&#146;s management is responsible for these financial statements. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these
financial statements based on our audits. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">We conducted our audits in accordance with standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United
States of America). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. The Company is not required to have, nor were we engaged to
perform, an audit of its internal control over financial reporting. Our audits included consideration of internal control over financial reporting as a basis of designing audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the
purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Company&#146;s internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and
disclosures in the financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits
provide a reasonable basis for our opinion. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the
financial position of HedgePath Pharmaceuticals, Inc. as of December&nbsp;31, 2014 and 2013 and the results of its operations and its cash flows for the years then ended in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United
States of America. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The accompanying financial statements have been prepared assuming that the Company will continue as a going concern. As discussed in
Note 2 to the financial statements, the Company incurred cumulative net losses since inception of approximately $32&nbsp;million at December 31, 2014, of which approximately $5.5 million was incurred subsequent to the emergence from bankruptcy, as
discussed in Note&nbsp;1. Furthermore, the Company expects to continue to incur net losses through the foreseeable future. These factors, among others as discussed in Note 2 to the financial statements, raise substantial doubt about the
Company&#146;s ability to continue as a going concern. Management&#146;s plans in regard to these matters are also described in Note 2. The accompanying financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this
uncertainty. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">/s/ Cherry Bekaert LLP </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Tampa, Florida </P>

&#147;HPPI&#148;, &#147;we&#148;, &#147;us&#148; or similar terminology) as successor to Commonwealth Biotechnologies, Inc., a Virginia corporation (&#147;CBI&#148;), have been prepared by the Company as a going concern. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; margin-left:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">As used herein, the term &#147;Common Stock&#148; means the Company&#146;s common stock, $0.0001 par value per share. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:18pt; margin-bottom:0pt; margin-left:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B><I>Nature of the Business </I></B></P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; margin-left:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The Company is a biopharmaceutical company that is seeking to discover, develop and commercialize innovative therapeutics for patients with
certain cancers.&nbsp;The Company&#146;s preliminary focus is on the development of therapies for skin, lung and prostate cancers in the U.S. market, with the first indication targeting basal cell carcinoma in patients with Basal Cell Carcinoma
Nevus Syndrome (also known as Gorlin Syndrome).&nbsp;The Company&#146;s proposed therapy is based upon the use of SUBA-Itraconazole, which is a patented, oral formulation of the currently marketed anti-fungal drug itraconazole. The Company believes
that the dosing of oral capsules of this formulation can affect the Hedgehog signaling pathway, a major regulator of many fundamental cellular processes, which, in turn, can impact the development and growth of cancers such as basal cell carcinoma.
Itraconazole is FDA approved for, and extensively used to, treat fungal infections and has an extensive history of safe and effective use in humans. The Company has developed, optioned and licensed intellectual property and know-how related to the
treatment of cancer patients using itraconazole and has applied for patents to cover the Company&#146;s inventions. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:18pt; margin-bottom:0pt; margin-left:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B><I>Pre-Bankruptcy
and Emergence from Bankruptcy </I></B></P> <P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; margin-left:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">CBI was a specialized life sciences outsourcing business that offered certain peptide-based
discovery chemistry and biology products and services. On January&nbsp;20, 2011, CBI filed a voluntary petition captioned <I>In re Commonwealth Biotechnologies, Inc., Case No.&nbsp;11-30381-KRH</I> (the &#147;Chapter 11 case&#148;) in the United
States Bankruptcy Court for the Eastern District of Virginia (the &#147;Bankruptcy Court&#148;) seeking relief under the provisions of Chapter 11 of Title 11 of the United States Code (the &#147;Bankruptcy Code&#148;). </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; margin-left:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">On August&nbsp;12, 2013, in furtherance of CBI&#146;s emergence from bankruptcy as described further below, CBI effected a
&#147;short-form&#148; reincorporation merger with HPPI, a newly created and wholly owned Delaware subsidiary of CBI, pursuant to which CBI merged with and into HPPI, with HPPI surviving the merger and with the effect of CBI becoming reincorporated
as a Delaware corporation and changing its corporate name. Each outstanding share of CBI was converted into one share of HPPI. HPPI&#146;s Certificate of Incorporation (and thus the Certificate of Incorporation of the surviving company) authorizes
the issuance of up to 340,000,000&nbsp;shares of common stock, par value $0.0001 per share, and 10,000,000&nbsp;shares of preferred stock, par value $0.0001 per share. The par value of the common stock was changed from no par value to $0.0001, which
par value is customary for newly formed Delaware corporations. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; margin-left:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">As described further below, the Company&#146;s present business is the
development of the currently-marketed drug itraconazole (currently approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (the &#147;FDA&#148;) as an anti-fungal agent) for the treatment of certain cancers. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; margin-left:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">On January&nbsp;4, 2013, CBI filed an Amended Plan of Reorganization (the &#147;Plan&#148;) with the Bankruptcy Court. The Plan was approved by
a vote of creditors and CBI stockholders on March&nbsp;21, 2013. CBI received an auction fee of $30,000 from Hedgepath, LLC, a Florida limited liability company, (which fee was a binding, irrevocable offer for the purchase of a portion of CBI&#146;s
equity interests) in addition to the contribution of Assets as described below. Hedgepath, LLC was the winning bidder for CBI, which is more fully described below in <I>Post-Bankruptcy Business of HPPI-General. </I>This auction fee was recognized as
an increase in additional paid-in capital when the Contribution Agreement (as defined below) became effective. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; margin-left:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">On March&nbsp;29, 2013, the
Bankruptcy Court entered an order (the &#147;Confirmation Order&#148;) confirming the Plan pursuant to Chapter 11 of the Bankruptcy Code. Under the terms of the Plan, and pursuant to the Contribution Agreement (as described further below),
Hedgepath, LLC contributed and assigned the Assets (as such term is defined below) to HPPI, as the reorganized debtor, in exchange for the right to receive 90% of the then fully diluted voting equity in HPPI (in the form of the Series A Preferred
Stock) on the date of issuance, with the prior stockholders of CBI retaining approximately 10% voting equity in HPPI, represented by 100% of the issued and outstanding shares of Common Stock. </P>

Pursuant to the Mayne Purchase Agreement, the Company (i)&nbsp;issued 258,363 shares of Series A Preferred Stock (the &#147;Mayne Series A Shares&#148;) and (ii)&nbsp;issued, upon closing of a separate Securities Purchase Agreement, dated
June&nbsp;24, 2014 (as described further below, the &#147;HPLLC Purchase Agreement&#148;) by and between the Company and HPLLC, a warrant to purchase 10,250,569 shares of Common Stock (the &#147;Mayne Make-Up Warrant&#148;). The Mayne Series A
Shares converted into 87,843,897 shares of Common Stock on August&nbsp;14, 2014 pursuant to the terms of the Equity Holders Agreement (discussed below) and in accordance with the terms of the Series A Preferred Stock. The Mayne Make-Up Warrant has
an exercise price of $0.0878 per share and may be exercised at any time, from time to time, by Mayne Pharma prior to the expiration on June&nbsp;24, 2019. In conjunction with the execution of the Mayne Purchase Agreement, the Company has expensed,
as in-process research and development costs, approximately $1.9 million for the fair value of the preferred stock and warrant issued. The value of the issued stock was calculated by taking approximately 42% of the market capitalization on the date
the agreement was entered into to reflect the 42% ownership exchanged for entering into the agreement. The value of the warrant was calculated by using the Black-Scholes valuation model that uses assumptions for expected volatility (104.9%),
expected dividends (none), expected term (5 years), and risk-free interest rate (1.7%). Expected volatilities are based on historical volatilities of peer companies. The risk-free rate is based upon the U.S. Treasury yield curve in effect at the
time of the grant for the period of the expected term. </P>

<P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; margin-left:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">In May 2014, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued Accounting Standards Update 2014-09, &#147;Revenue from Contracts with
Customers,&#148; which supersedes the revenue recognition requirements of Accounting Standards Codification (&#147;ASC&#148;) Topic 605, &#147;Revenue Recognition&#148; and most industry-specific guidance on revenue recognition throughout the ASC.
The new standard is principles-based and provides a five step model to determine when and how revenue is recognized. The core principle of the new standard is that revenue should be recognized when a company transfers promised goods or services to
customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the company expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. The new standard also requires disclosure of qualitative and quantitative information surrounding the amount,
nature, timing and uncertainty of revenues and cash flows arising from contracts with customers. The new standard will be effective for the Company for annual reporting periods beginning after December&nbsp;15, 2016 and can be applied either
retrospectively to all periods presented or as a cumulative-effect adjustment as of the date of adoption. Early adoption is not permitted. The Company will evaluate the impact of adoption of the new standard on its financial statements upon
commencement of revenue generating activities. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:18pt; margin-bottom:0pt; margin-left:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B><I>Estimates </I></B></P>

(&#147;ASC&#148;) Topic 852&#151;<I>Reorganizations </I>(&#147;ASC Topic 852&#148;), which is applicable to companies in Chapter 11, generally does not change the manner in which financial statements are prepared. However, it does require that the
financial statements for periods subsequent to the filing of the Chapter 11 petition distinguish transactions and events that are directly associated with the reorganization from the ongoing operations of the business. Revenues, expenses, realized
gains and losses, and provisions for losses that can be directly associated with the reorganization and restructuring of the business must be reported separately as reorganization items in the statements of operations beginning in the quarter ending
March&nbsp;31, 2011. The balance sheet must distinguish prepetition liabilities subject to compromise from both those prepetition liabilities that are not subject to compromise and from post-petition liabilities. Liabilities that may be affected by
a plan of reorganization must be reported at the amounts expected to be allowed by the Bankruptcy Court, even if they may be settled for lesser amounts. In addition, cash flows from reorganization items must be disclosed separately in the statement
of cash flows. The Company became subject to ASC Topic 852 effective on January&nbsp;20, 2011, and has segregated those items as outlined above. The Company officially emerged from bankruptcy on April&nbsp;17, 2013, followed by the reincorporation
merger and contribution of assets by HPLLC, which satisfied the final condition to effectiveness of the Plan as detailed in Note 1. Accordingly, all pre-petition liabilities had been settled as of December&nbsp;31, 2013, and there are no further

of Accentia and its former subsidiary, Biovest International, Inc. (collectively the &#147;Class Action&#148;), including Frank E. O&#146;Donnell, Jr. M.D., the Company&#146;s Executive Chairman. The complaints allege that the defendants violated

Biovest&#146;s cancer vaccine, BiovaxID, and status of its approval by the FDA. Plaintiffs seek damages in an unspecified amount on behalf of shareholders who purchased common stock of Accentia or Biovest during a defined time period. All

wrongdoing or liability, has been agreed upon by all parties and approved by the Court. </P>
