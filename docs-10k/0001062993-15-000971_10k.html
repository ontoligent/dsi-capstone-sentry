<P align=justify><I>Corporate Overview </I></P>
<P align=justify>We were incorporated in the state of Nevada on June 5, 2008
under the name Business Outsourcing Services, Inc. Effective August 31, 2011, we
completed a merger with Orgenesis Inc., a Nevada corporation which was
incorporated solely to effect a change in our name. As a result, we changed our
name from &#147;Business Outsourcing Services, Inc.&#148; to &#147;Orgenesis Inc.&#148; </P>
<P align=justify>Effective August 31, 2011, we implemented a 35 to 1 forward
stock split of our authorized and issued and outstanding common stock. As a
result, our authorized capital has increased from 50,000,000 shares of common
stock with a par value of $0.0001 to 1,750,000,000 shares of common stock with a
par value of $0.0001. On February 27, 2012, we filed a Certificate of Correction
with the Secretary of State of the State of Nevada, correcting the par value of
1,750,000,000 shares of common stock that was incorrectly stated as $0.001 to
1,750,000,000 shares of common stock with a par value of $0.0001. Unless
otherwise noted, all references in this quarterly report to number of shares,
price per share or weighted average number of shares outstanding have been
adjusted to reflect the stock split on a retroactive basis. </P>
<P align=justify><I>Our Current Business </I></P>
<P align=justify>We are developing a technology that we are bringing to the
clinical stage that demonstrates the capacity to induce a shift in the
developmental fate of cells from the liver and differentiating (converting) them
into &#147;pancreatic beta cell like&#148; insulin producing cells for patients with Type
1 Diabetes. </P>
<P align=justify>On August 5, 2011, we entered into a letter of intent with
Prof. Sarah Ferber and Ms. Vered Caplan according to which, inter alia, Prof.
Ferber has agreed to use commercially reasonable efforts to cause THM to license
us all of the assets associated with &#147;Methods Of Inducing Regulated Pancreatic
Hormone Production&#148; and &#147;Methods of Inducing Regulated Pancreatic Hormone
Production In Non-Pancreatic Islet Tissues&#148;. </P>
<P align=justify>On October 11, 2011, we incorporated Orgenesis Ltd. as our
wholly-owned Israeli Subsidiary under the laws of Israel. On February 2, 2012,
Orgenesis Ltd. signed and closed a definitive agreement to license patents and
knowhow related to the development of autologous insulin producing (&#147;AIP&#148;)
cells. Based on the licensed knowhow and patents, our intention is to develop to
the clinical stage a new technology for regeneration of functional
insulin-producing cells, thus enabling normal glucose regulated insulin
secretion, via cell therapy. By using therapeutic agent (i.e., PDX-1, and
additional pancreatic transcription factors in an adenovirus-vector) that
efficiently converts a sub-population of liver cells into pancreatic islets
phenotype and function, this approach allows the diabetic patient to be the
donor of his own therapeutic tissue. The development of AIP cells is based on
the licensed patents and knowhow of THM and Prof. Ferber. We believe that our
major competitive advantage is in our cell transformation technology. </P>
<P align=justify>This technology was licensed based on the published work of
Prof. Ferber who has developed this technology, as a researcher in THM, and has
established a proof of concept that demonstrates the capacity to induce a shift
in the developmental fate of cells from the liver and differentiating
(converting) them into &#147;pancreatic beta cell-like&#148; insulin-producing cells. Furthermore, those cells were found to
be resistant to the autoimmune attack and to produce insulin in a

<P align=justify><I>Development </I></P>
<P align=justify>Our goal is to advance a unique product that combines
cell-based therapy and regenerative medicine, Autologous Insulin Producing (AIP)
cells, into clinical development. AIP cells utilize the technology of &#145;cellular
trans-differentiation&#146; to transform an autologous adult liver cell into an
adult, fully functional and physiologically glucose-responsive pancreatic-like
insulin producing cell. Treatment with AIP cells is expected to provide Type 1
Diabetes patients with long-term insulin independence. Because the AIP cells are
autologous, this benefit should be achieved and maintained without the need for
concomitant immunosuppressive therapy. The procedure to generate AIP cells
begins with liver tissue accessed via needle biopsy from a patient. The liver
tissue is then sent to a central facility where biopsied liver cells are
isolated, expanded and trans-differentiated into AIP cells. The final product is
a solution of AIP cells, which are packaged in an infusion bag and sent back to
the patient&#146;s treating physician where the cells are transplanted back into the patient&#146;s liver via
portal vein infusion. The entire process, from biopsy to transplantation, is
expected to take 5-6 weeks. </P>

<P align=justify><I>Future Products</I> </P>
<P align=justify>Currently, liver cells are best suited for generating AIP
cells. Future products may involve the use of cell types other than liver that
are more easily accessible from the diabetic patient or from unrelated donors.
Additionally, other adult cells (i.e. fibroblasts) may be studied for
trans-differentiation into functional cells in diseases other than
insulin-dependent disorders (i.e. neurodegenerative). </P>
<P align=justify><I>Market </I></P>
<P align=justify>Diabetes Mellitus (DM), or simply diabetes, is a metabolic
disorder usually caused by a combination of hereditary and environmental
factors, and results in abnormally high blood sugar levels (hyperglycemia).
Diabetes occurs as a result of impaired insulin production by the pancreatic
islet cells. The most common types of the disease are type-1 diabetes (T1D) and
type-2 diabetes (T2D). I n T1D, the onset of the disease follows an autoimmune
attack of &#946;-cells that severely reduces &#946;-cell mass. T1D usually has an early
onset and is sometimes also called juvenile diabetes. In T2D, the pathogenesis
involves insulin resistance, insulin deficiency and enhanced gluconeogenesis,
while late progression stages eventually leads to &#946;-cell failure and a
significant reduction in &#946;-cell function and mass. T2D often occurs later in
life and is sometimes called adult onset diabetes. Both T1D and late-stage T2D
result in marked hypoinsulinemia, reduction in &#946;-cell function and mass and lead
to severe secondary complications, such as myocardial infarcts, limb
amputations, neuropathies and nephropathies and even death. In both cases,
patients become insulin-dependent, requiring either multiple insulin injections
per day or reliance on an insulin pump. </P>
<P align=justify>We believe that diabetes will be one of the most challenging
health problems in the 21st century, and will have a staggering health,
societal, and economic impact. Diabetes is currently the fourth or fifth leading
cause of death in most developed countries. There also is substantial evidence
that it is an epidemic in many developing and newly industrialized nations. </P>
<P align=justify><I>Competition </I></P>
<P align=justify>Insulin therapy is used for Insulin-Dependent Diabetes Mellitus
(IDDM) patients who are not controlled with oral medications, but this therapy
has well-known and well-characterized disadvantages. Weight gain is a common
side effect of insulin therapy, which is a risk factor for cardiovascular
disease. Injection of insulin causes pain and inconvenience for patients.
Patient compliance and inconvenience of self-administering multiple daily
insulin injections is also considered a disadvantage of this therapy. The most
serious adverse effect of insulin therapy is hypoglycemia. </P>

<I>Threats from Pancreas Islet Transplantation and Cell Therapies </I></P>
<P align="justify">
<B>Transplant procedure </B></P>
<P align="justify">
For some patients with severe and difficult to control diabetes (hypoglycemic unawareness), islet transplants are considered. Pancreatic islets are the cells in the pancreas that produce insulin. Physicians use enzymes to isolate the islets from the
pancreas of a deceased donor. Because the islets are fragile, transplantation must occur soon after they are removed. Typically a patient receives at least 10,000 islet &ldquo;equivalents&rdquo; per kilogram of body weight, extracted from pancreases
obtained from different donors. Patients often require two separate transplants to achieve insulin independence.</P>
<P align="justify">
Transplants are often performed by an interventional radiologist, who uses x-rays and ultrasound to guide placement of a catheter&mdash;a small plastic tube&mdash;through the upper abdomen and into the portal vein of the liver. The islets are then
infused slowly through the catheter into the liver. The patient receives a local anesthetic and a sedative. In some cases, a surgeon may perform the transplant through a small incision, using general anesthesia. </P>
<P align="justify">
Because the islets are obtained from cadavers that are unrelated to the patient, the patient needs to be treated with drugs that inhibit the immune response so that the patient doesn&rsquo;t reject the transplant. In the early days of islet
transplantation, the drugs were so powerful that they actually were toxic to the islets; improvements in the procedure called the Edmonton protocol are now widely used instead. </P>
<P align="justify">
<B>Studies and reports </B></P>
<P align="justify">
Since reporting their findings in the June 2000 issue of the <I>New England Journal of Medicine</I>, researchers at the University of Alberta in Edmonton, Canada, have continued to use and refine a procedure called the Edmonton protocol to
transplant pancreatic islets into selected patients with type 1 diabetes that is difficult to control. </P>
<P align="justify">
In 2005, the researchers published 5-year follow-up results for 65 patients who received transplants at their center and reported that about 10 percent of the patients remained free of the need for insulin injections at 5-year follow-up. Most
recipients returned to using insulin because the transplanted islets lost their ability to function over time, potentially due to the immune suppression protocol, which prevents the immune rejection of the implanted cells. The researchers noted,
however, that many transplant recipients were able to reduce their need for insulin, achieve better glucose stability, and reduce problems with hypoglycemia, also called low blood sugar level. </P>
<P align="justify">
In its 2006 annual report, the Collaborative Islet Transplant Registry, which is funded by the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases, presented data from 23 islet transplant programs on 225 patients who received islet
transplants between 1999 and 2005. According to the report, nearly two-thirds of recipients achieved &ldquo;insulin independence&rdquo;&mdash;defined as being able to stop insulin injections for at least 14 days&mdash;during the year following
transplantation.  However, other data from the report showed that insulin independence is difficult to maintain over time. Six months after their last infusion of islets, more than half of recipients were free of the need for insulin injections, but
at 2-year follow-up, the proportion dropped to about one-third of recipients. The report described other benefits of islet transplantation, including reduced need for insulin among recipients who still needed insulin, improved blood glucose control,
and greatly reduced risk of episodes of severe hypoglycemia. </P>
<P align="justify">
In a 2006 report of the Immune Tolerance Network&rsquo;s international islet transplantation study, researchers emphasized the value of transplantation in reversing a condition known as hypoglycemia unawareness. People with hypoglycemia unawareness
are vulnerable to dangerous episodes of severe hypoglycemia because they are not able to recognize that their blood glucose levels are too low. The study showed that even partial islet function after transplant can eliminate hypoglycemia
unawareness. </P>

Pancreatic islet transplantation (cadaver donors) is an allogeneic transplant, and as in all allogeneic transplantations there is a risk for graft rejection and patients must receive lifelong immune suppressants. Though this technology has shown

<P align=justify><I>Government Regulations </I></P>
<P align=justify>We have not sought approval from the FDA for the AIP cells.
Among all forms of cell therapy modalities, we believe that autologous cell
replacement therapy seems to be of the highest benefit. We believe that it seems
to be safer than other options as it does not alter the host genome but only
alters the set of expressed epigenetic information that seems to be highly
specific to the reprogramming protocol. It provides an abundant source of
therapeutic tissue, which is not rejected by the patient and does not have to be
treated by immune suppressants. It is highly ethical since no human organ
donations or embryo-derived cells are needed. The proposed therapeutic approach
does not require cell bio-banking at birth, which is both expensive and cannot
be used for patients born prior to 2000. </P>
<P align=justify>Within the last decade, many studies published in leading
scientific journal confirmed the capacity of reprogramming adult cells from many
of our mature organs to either alternate organs or to &#147;stem like cells&#148;. The
most widely used autologous cell replacement protocol is the one used for
autologous implantation of bone marrow stem cells. This protocol is widely used
in patients undergoing a massive chemotherapy session that destroys their bone
marrow cells. However, the stem cells used for cancer patients delineated above
do not require extensive manipulation and is regarded by FDA as &#147;minimally
manipulated&#148;. </P>
<P align=justify>An additional autologous cell therapy approach already used in
man is autologous chondrocyte implantation (ACI). In the United States, Genzyme
Corporation provides the only FDA approved ACI treatment: Carticel. The Carticel
treatment is designated for young, healthy patients with medium to large sized
damage to cartilage. During an initial procedure, the patient&#146;s own chondrocytes
are removed arthroscopically from a non-load-bearing area from either the
intercondylar notch or the superior ridge of the medial or lateral femoral
condyles. </P>
<P align=justify>To aid us in our efforts to achieve the highest level of
compliance with FDA requirements, we have looked to hire experts in the field of
pharmaceutical compliance. </P>
<P align=justify><I>Regulatory Process in the United States</I> </P>
<P align=justify>Our product is subject to regulation as a biological product
under the <I>Public Health Service Act</I> and the <I>Food, Drug and Cosmetic
Act</I>. FDA generally requires the following steps for pre-market approval or
licensure of a new biological product: </P>
<UL style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify">
  <LI>Pre-clinical laboratory and animal tests conducted in compliance with the
  Good Laboratory Practice, or GLP, requirements to assess a drug&#146;s biological
  activity and to identify potential safety problems, and to characterize and
  document the product&#146;s chemistry, manufacturing controls, formulation, and
  stability;
  <LI>Submission to FDA of an Investigational New Drug, or IND application,
  which must become effective before clinical testing in humans can begin;
  <LI>Obtaining approval of Institutional Review Boards, or IRBs, of research
  institutions or other clinical sites to introduce the biologic drug candidate

  trials;
  <LI>FDA reviews the marketing application in order to determine, among other
  things, whether the product is safe, effective and potent for its intended
  uses; and
  <LI>Obtaining FDA approval of the BLA, including inspection and approval of
  the product manufacturing facility as compliant with cGMP requirements, prior
  to any commercial sale or shipment of the pharmaceutical agent. FDA may also
  require post marketing testing and surveillance of approved products, or place
  other conditions on the approvals. </LI></UL>

  <i>Regulatory Process in Europe</i> </P>
<P align="justify">The European Union (&ldquo;EU&rdquo;) has approved a regulation specific to cell and tissue therapy product, the Advanced Therapy Medicinal Product (ATMP) regulation. For products such as our AIP that are regulated as an ATMP, the EU Directive
  requires: </P>
<UL style="text-align:justify;">
<LI>
Compliance with current Good Manufacturing Practices, or cGMP regulations and standards, pre-clinical laboratory and animal testing;</LI>
<LI>
Filing a Clinical Trial Application (CTA) with the various member states or a centralized procedure; Voluntary Harmonization Procedure (VHP), a procedure which makes it possible to obtain a coordinated assessment of an application for a clinical
trial that is to take place in several European countries;</LI>
<LI>
Obtaining approval of Ethic Committees of research institutions or other clinical sites to introduce the AIP into humans in clinical trials;</LI>
<LI>
Adequate and well-controlled clinical trials to establish the safety and efficacy of the product for its intended use; and</LI>
<LI>
Submission to EMEA for a Marketing Authorization (MA); Review and approval of the MAA (Marketing Authorization Application).</LI>
</UL>
<P align="justify">
<I>Clinical trials</I> </P>
<P align="justify">
Typically, both in the U.S. and the European Union, clinical testing involves a three-phase process although the phases may overlap. In Phase I, clinical trials are conducted with a small number of healthy volunteers or patients and are designed to
provide information about product safety and to evaluate the pattern of drug distribution and metabolism within the body. In Phase II, clinical trials are conducted with groups of patients afflicted with a specific disease in order to determine
preliminary efficacy, optimal dosages and expanded evidence of safety. In some cases, an initial trial is conducted in diseased patients to assess both preliminary efficacy and preliminary safety and patterns of drug metabolism and distribution, in
which case it is referred to as a Phase I/II trial. Phase III clinical trials are generally large-scale, multi-center, comparative trials conducted with patients afflicted with a target disease in order to provide statistically valid proof of
efficacy, as well as safety and potency. In some circumstances, FDA or EMA may require Phase IV or post-marketing trials if it feels that additional information needs to be collected about the drug after it is on the market. During all phases of
clinical development, regulatory agencies require extensive monitoring and auditing of all clinical activities, clinical data and clinical trial investigators. An agency may, at its discretion, re-evaluate, alter, suspend, or terminate the testing
based upon the data that have been accumulated to that point and its assessment of the risk/benefit ratio to the patient. Monitoring all aspects of the study to minimize risks is a continuing process. All adverse events must be reported to the FDA
or EMA<I>.</I> </P>

<B>ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS</B> </P>
<P align="justify">
An investment in our common stock involves a number of very significant risks. You should carefully consider the following risks and uncertainties in addition to other information in this report in evaluating our company and its business before
purchasing shares of our company&rsquo;s common stock. Our business, operating results and financial condition could be seriously harmed due to any of the following risks. You could lose all or part of your investment due to any of these risks. </P>
<P align="justify">
<I>Risks Related to Our Company </I></P>
<P align="justify">
<B>There is substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern. </B></P>
<P align="justify">
We have not generated any revenue from operations since our inception. We expect that our operating expenses will increase over the next twelve months to continue our development activities. We estimate our average monthly expenses over the next
twelve months to be approximately &#36;491,000, including general and administrative expenses and research and development. This amount could increase if we encounter difficulties that we cannot anticipate at this time. As of the date of this
filing, we had cash and cash equivalents of approximately &#36;485,284. We do not expect to raise capital through debt financing from traditional lending sources since we are not currently producing revenue and cannot assure a lender that we will be able
to successfully achieve commercial revenues from the development of our technology. Therefore, we only expect to raise money through equity financing via the sale of our common stock. If we cannot raise the money that we need in order to continue to
operate our business, we will be forced to delay, scale back or eliminate some or all of our proposed operations. If any of these were to occur, there is a substantial risk that our business would fail. If we are unsuccessful in raising additional financing, we may need to curtail, discontinue or cease operations. </P>

During 2014, we have received certain grant funding and have relied and expect to continue to rely on such funding to further our clinical development in the future. </P>
<P align="justify">
On June 30, 2014, our U.S. Subsidiary entered into a grant agreement with Maryland Technology Development Corporation (&ldquo;TEDCO&rdquo;). TEDCO was created by the Maryland State Legislature in 1998 to facilitate the transfer and commercialization
of technology from Maryland&rsquo;s research universities and federal labs into the marketplace and to assist in the creation and growth of technology-based businesses in all regions of the State. Under the agreement, TEDCO has agreed to give us an
amount not to exceed &#36;406,431 to be used solely to finance the costs to conduct the research project entitled &ldquo;Autologous Insulin Producing (AIP) Cells for Diabetes&rdquo; during a period of two years. On July 22, 2014, our U.S. Subsidiary
received an advance payment of &#36;203,215 on account of the grant. Through November 30, 2014, an amount of &#36;118,305 out of the &#36;203,215 was spent. </P>
<P align="justify">
On November 17, 2014, our Belgian Subsidiary received the formal approval from the Walloon Region, Belgium (Service Public of Wallonia, DGO6) for a &euro;2.015 million support program for the research and development of a potential cure for Type 1
Diabetes. The Financial support is composed of a 1,085,000 Euros (70% of budgeted costs) grant for the industrial research part of the research program and a further recoverable advance of 930,000 Euros (60% of budgeted costs) of the experimental
development part of the research program. The grants will be paid to us over a period of approximately 3 years. The grants are subject to certain conditions with respect to our work in the Walloon Region, our own investment in these projects and
certain other conditions. On December 9 and 16, 2014, we received &euro;651,000 and &euro;558,000 under the grant, respectively, to have relied on grant funding in 2014 may need to raise additional funds in the future that may not be available on

On December 21, 2014, we received a notification from the Israel-U.S. Binational Industrial Research and Development Foundation (&ldquo;BIRD&rdquo;) that our Israeli Subsidiary, and our research and development partner, have been approved by BIRD's
Board of Governors for a conditional grant of &#36;800,000 for a joint research and development project for the use Autologous Insulin Producing (AIP) Cells for the Treatment of Diabetes (the &ldquo;Project&rdquo;). A Cooperation and Project Funding
Agreement (CPFA) must be signed for the Project with the BIRD Foundation within three months, or by March 31, 2015. Up to the date of this report, we have not received these funds and may be unable to obtain these funds if we are not able to provide
sufficient information to BIRD or if our CPFA is not accepted by such date. </P>

<B>We may need to raise additional funds in the future that may not be available on acceptable terms or at all. </B></P>
<P align="justify">
We may consider issuing additional debt or equity securities in the future to fund clinical trials, for potential acquisitions or investments, to refinance existing debt, or for general corporate purposes.  If we issue equity or convertible debt
securities to raise additional funds, our existing stockholders may experience dilution, and the new equity or debt securities may have rights, preferences and privileges senior to those of our existing stockholders. If we incur additional debt, it
may increase our leverage relative to our earnings or to our equity capitalization, requiring us to pay additional interest expenses. We may not be able to obtain financing on favorable terms, or at all, in which case, we may not be able to develop

<P align="justify">
We are an early-stage company with only a limited operating history upon which to base an evaluation of our current business and future prospects. As a result, the revenue and income potential of our business is unproven. In addition, because of our
limited operating history, we have limited insight into trends that may emerge and affect our business. Errors may be made in predicting and reacting to relevant business trends, and we will be subject to the risks, uncertainties and difficulties
frequently encountered by early-stage companies in evolving markets. We may not be able to successfully address any or all of these risks and uncertainties. Failure to adequately do so could cause our business, results of operations and financial

<B>Extensive industry regulation has had, and will continue to have, a significant impact on our business, especially our product development, manufacturing and distribution capabilities. </B></P>
<P align="justify">
All pharmaceutical companies are subject to extensive, complex, costly and evolving government regulation. For the U.S., this is principally administered by the FDA and to a lesser extent by the Drug Enforcement Administration (&ldquo;DEA&rdquo;)
and state government agencies, as well as by varying regulatory agencies in foreign countries where products or product candidates are being manufactured and/or marketed. The Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act, the Controlled Substances Act and
other federal statutes and regulations, and similar foreign statutes and regulations, govern or influence the testing, manufacturing, packing, labeling, storing, record keeping, safety, approval, advertising, promotion, sale and distribution of our
future products. </P>
<P align="justify">
Under these regulations, we may become subject to periodic inspection of our facilities, procedures and operations and/or the testing of our future products by the FDA, the DEA and other authorities, which conduct periodic inspections to confirm
that we are in compliance with all applicable regulations. In addition, the FDA and foreign regulatory agencies conduct pre-approval and post-approval reviews and plant inspections to determine whether our systems and processes are in compliance
with current good manufacturing practice (&ldquo;cGMP&rdquo;) and other regulations. Following such inspections, the FDA or other agency may issue observations, notices, citations and/or warning letters that could cause us to modify certain
activities identified during the inspection. FDA guidelines specify that a warning letter is issued only for violations of &ldquo;regulatory significance&rdquo; for which the failure to adequately and promptly achieve correction may be expected to
result in an enforcement action. We may also be required to report adverse events associated with our future products to FDA and other regulatory authorities. Unexpected or serious health or safety concerns would result in labeling changes, recalls,
market withdrawals or other regulatory actions. </P>
<P align="justify">
The range of possible sanctions includes, among others, FDA issuance of adverse publicity, product recalls or seizures, fines, total or partial suspension of production and/or distribution, suspension of the FDA&rsquo;s review of product
applications, enforcement actions, injunctions, and civil or criminal prosecution. Any such sanctions, if imposed, could have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results, financial condition and cash flows. Under certain
circumstances, the FDA also has the authority to revoke previously granted drug approvals. Similar sanctions as detailed above may be available to the FDA under a consent decree, depending upon the actual terms of such decree. If internal compliance
programs do not meet regulatory agency standards or if compliance is deemed deficient in any significant way, it could materially harm our business. </P>
<P align="justify">
For Europe, the European Medicines Agency (&ldquo;EMEA&rdquo;) will regulate our future products. Regulatory approval by the EMEA will be subject to the evaluation of data relating to the quality, efficacy and safety of our future products for its
proposed use. The time taken to obtain regulatory approval varies between countries. Different regulators may impose their own requirements and may refuse to grant, or may require additional data before granting, an approval, notwithstanding that
regulatory approval may have been granted by other regulators. Regulatory approval may be delayed, limited or denied for a number of reasons, including insufficient clinical data, the product not meeting safety or efficacy requirements or any
relevant manufacturing processes or facilities not meeting applicable requirements. </P>
<P align="justify">
Further trials and other costly and time-consuming assessments of the product may be required to obtain or maintain regulatory approval. Medicinal products are generally subject to lengthy and rigorous pre-clinical and clinical trials and other
extensive, costly and time-consuming procedures mandated by regulatory authorities.  We may be required to conduct additional trials beyond those currently planned, which could require significant time and expense. </P>

to those that we currently anticipate.  If we are successful in obtaining regulatory approvals to market one or more of our product candidates, our revenue will be dependent, in part, upon the size of the markets in the territories for which we gain
regulatory approval, the accepted price for the product, the ability to get reimbursement at any price, and whether we own the commercial rights for that territory. If the number of our addressable disease patients is not as significant as we
estimate, the indication approved by regulatory authorities is narrower than we expect, or the reasonably accepted population for treatment is narrowed by competition, physician choice or treatment guidelines, we may not generate significant revenue
from sales of such products, even if approved. If we are not able to generate revenue from the sale of any approved products, we may never become profitable. </P>

<P align="justify">
<B>Our product candidates are biologics and the manufacture of our product candidates is complex and we may encounter difficulties in production, particularly with respect to process development or scaling-out of our manufacturing capabilities.
</B></P>
<P align="justify">
If we or our third-party manufacturers encounter such difficulties, our ability to provide supply of our product candidates for clinical trials or our products for patients, if approved, could be delayed or stopped, or we may be unable to maintain a
commercially viable cost structure. Our product candidates are biologics and the process of manufacturing our products is complex, highly regulated and subject to multiple risks. The manufacture of our product candidates involves complex processes,
including the biopsy of tissue from a patient&rsquo;s liver, propagation of the patient&rsquo;s liver cells from that liver tissue to obtain the desired dose, trans-differentiating those cells into insulin-producing cells ex vivo and ultimately
infusing the cells back into a patient&rsquo;s body. As a result of the complexities, the cost to manufacture biologics is generally higher than traditional small molecule chemical compounds, and the manufacturing process is less reliable and is
more difficult to reproduce.  Our manufacturing process will be susceptible to product loss or failure due to logistical issues associated with the collection of liver cells, or starting material, from the patient, shipping such material to the
manufacturing site, shipping the final product back to the patient, and infusing the patient with the product, manufacturing issues associated with the differences in patient starting materials, interruptions in the manufacturing process,
contamination, equipment or reagent failure, improper installation or operation of equipment, vendor or operator error, inconsistency in cell growth, and variability in product characteristics.  Even minor deviations from normal manufacturing
processes could result in reduced production yields, product defects, and other supply disruptions.  If for any reason we lose a patient&rsquo;s starting material or later-developed product at any point in the process, the manufacturing process for
that patient will need to be restarted and the resulting delay may adversely affect that patient&rsquo;s outcome. If microbial, viral, or other contaminations are discovered in our product candidates or in the manufacturing facilities in which our
product candidates are made, such manufacturing facilities may need to be closed for an extended period of time to investigate and remedy the contamination. Because our product candidates are manufactured for each particular patient, we will be required to maintain a chain of identity with respect to materials as they move from the patient to the manufacturing facility, through the manufacturing process, and back to the patient. Maintaining such a chain of identity is
difficult and complex, and failure to do so could result in adverse patient outcomes, loss of product, or regulatory action including withdrawal of our products from the market.  Further, as product candidates are developed through preclinical to
late stage clinical trials towards approval and commercialization, it is common that various aspects of the development program, such as manufacturing methods, are altered along the way in an effort to optimize processes and results. Such changes
carry the risk that they will not achieve these intended objectives, and any of these changes could cause our product candidates to perform differently and affect the results of planned clinical trials or other future clinical trials. </P>

Although we are working to develop commercially viable processes, doing so is a difficult and uncertain task, and there are risks associated with scaling to the level required for advanced clinical trials or commercialization, including, among
others, cost overruns, potential problems with process scale-out, process reproducibility, stability issues, lot consistency, and timely availability of reagents or raw materials. We may ultimately be unable to reduce the cost of goods for our
product candidates to levels that will allow for an attractive return on investment if and when those product candidates are commercialized. </P>
<P align="justify">
We expect our manufacturing strategy will involve the use of one or more CMOs as well as establishing our own capabilities and infrastructure, including a manufacturing facility.  We expect that development of our own manufacturing facility will
provide us with enhanced control of material supply for both clinical trials and the commercial market, enable the more rapid implementation of process changes, and allow for better long-term margins. However, we have no experience as a company in
developing a manufacturing facility and may never be successful in developing our own manufacturing facility or capability. We may establish multiple manufacturing facilities as we expand our commercial footprint to multiple geographies, which may
lead to regulatory delays or prove costly.  Even if we are successful, our manufacturing capabilities could be affected by cost-overruns, unexpected delays, equipment failures, labor shortages, natural disasters, power failures and numerous other
factors that could prevent us from realizing the intended benefits of our manufacturing strategy and have a material adverse effect on our business. </P>
<P align="justify">
In addition, the manufacturing process for any products that we may develop is subject to FDA and foreign regulatory authority approval process, and we will need to contract with manufacturers who can meet all applicable FDA and foreign regulatory
authority requirements on an ongoing basis. If we or our CMOs are unable to reliably produce products to specifications acceptable to the FDA or other regulatory authorities, we may not obtain or maintain the approvals we need to commercialize such
products. Even if we obtain regulatory approval for any of our product candidates, there is no assurance that either we or our CMOs will be able to manufacture the approved product to specifications acceptable to the FDA or other regulatory
authorities, to produce it in sufficient quantities to meet the requirements for the potential launch of the product, or to meet potential future demand. Any of these challenges could delay completion of clinical trials, require bridging clinical
trials or the repetition of one or more clinical trials, increase clinical trial costs, delay approval of our product candidate, impair commercialization efforts, increase our cost of goods, and have an adverse effect on our business, financial

We do not currently own any facility that may be used as our clinical-scale manufacturing and processing facility and must currently rely on outside vendors to manufacture supplies and process our product candidates, which is and will need to be

The manufacture of biological drug products is complex and requires significant expertise and capital investment, including the development of advanced manufacturing techniques and process controls. Manufacturers of biologic products often encounter
difficulties in production, particularly in scaling up or out, validating the production process, and assuring high reliability of the manufacturing process (including the absence of contamination). These problems include logistics and shipping,
difficulties with production costs and yields, quality control, including stability of the product, product testing, operator error, availability of qualified personnel, as well as compliance with strictly enforced federal, state and foreign
regulations. Furthermore, if contaminants are discovered in our supply of our product candidates or in the manufacturing facilities, such manufacturing facilities may need to be closed for an extended period of time to investigate and remedy the
contamination. We cannot assure you that any stability failures or other issues relating to the manufacture of our product candidates will not occur in the future. Additionally, our manufacturers may experience manufacturing difficulties due to
resource constraints or as a result of labor disputes or unstable political environments.  If our manufacturers were to encounter any of these difficulties, or otherwise fail to comply with their contractual obligations, our ability to provide our
product candidate to patients in clinical trials would be jeopardized. Any delay or interruption in the supply of clinical trial supplies could delay the completion of clinical trials, increase the costs associated with maintaining clinical trial

Manufacturing our product candidates will require many reagents, which are substances used in our manufacturing processes to bring about chemical or biological reactions, and other specialty materials and equipment, some of which are manufactured or
supplied by small companies with limited resources and experience to support commercial biologics production. We currently depend on a limited number of vendors for certain materials and equipment used in the manufacture of our product candidates.
Some of these suppliers may not have the capacity to support commercial products manufactured under cGMP by biopharmaceutical firms or may otherwise be ill-equipped to support our needs. We also do not have supply contracts with many of these
suppliers and may not be able to obtain supply contracts with them on acceptable terms or at all. Accordingly, we may experience delays in receiving key materials and equipment to support clinical or commercial manufacturing. </P>
<P align="justify">
For some of these reagents, equipment, and materials, we rely and may in the future rely on sole source vendors or a limited number of vendors. An inability to continue to source product from any of these suppliers, which could be due to regulatory
actions or requirements affecting the supplier, adverse financial or other strategic developments experienced by a supplier, labor disputes or shortages, unexpected demands, or quality issues, could adversely affect our ability to satisfy demand for
our product candidates, which could adversely and materially affect our product sales and operating results or our ability to conduct clinical trials, either of which could significantly harm our business. </P>
<P align="justify">
As we continue to develop and scale our manufacturing process, we expect that we will need to obtain rights to and supplies of certain materials and equipment to be used as part of that process. We may not be able to obtain rights to such materials
on commercially reasonable terms, or at all, and if we are unable to alter our process in a commercially viable manner to avoid the use of such materials or find a suitable substitute, it would have a material adverse effect on our business. </P>
<P align="justify">
<B>We currently have no marketing and sales organization and have no experience in marketing products. If we are unable to establish marketing and sales capabilities or enter into agreements with third parties to market and sell our product
candidates, we may not be able to generate product revenue. </B></P>
<P align="justify">
We currently have no sales, marketing, or commercial product distribution capabilities and have no experience in marketing products. We intend to develop an in-house marketing organization and sales force, which will require significant capital
expenditures, management resources, and time.  We will have to compete with other pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies to recruit, hire, train, and retain marketing and sales personnel. If we are unable or decide not to establish internal
sales, marketing and commercial distribution capabilities for any or all products we develop, we will likely pursue collaborative arrangements regarding the sales and marketing of our products.  However, there can be no assurance that we will be
able to establish or maintain such collaborative arrangements, or if we are able to do so, that they will have effective sales forces. Any revenue we receive will depend upon the efforts of such third parties, which may not be successful. We may
have little or no control over the marketing and sales efforts of such third parties, and our revenue from product sales may be lower than if we had commercialized our product candidates ourselves. We also face competition in our search for third
parties to assist us with the sales and marketing efforts of our product candidates. </P>
<P align="justify">
There can be no assurance that we will be able to develop in-house sales and commercial distribution capabilities or establish or maintain relationships with third-party collaborators to successfully commercialize any product in the United States or
overseas, and as a result, we may not be able to generate product revenue. </P>
<P align="justify">
A variety of risks associated with operating our business internationally could materially adversely affect our business.  We plan to seek regulatory approval of our product candidates outside of the United States and, accordingly, we expect that
we, and any potential collaborators in those jurisdictions, will be subject to additional risks related to operating in foreign countries, including: </P>

<B>We face significant competition from other biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies, and our operating results will suffer if we fail to compete effectively. </B></P>
<P align="justify">
The biopharmaceutical industry, and the rapidly evolving market for developing cell-based therapies in particular, is characterized by intense competition and rapid innovation.  Our competitors may be able to develop other compounds or drugs that
are able to achieve similar or better results.  Our potential competitors include major multinational pharmaceutical companies, established biotechnology companies, specialty pharmaceutical companies, universities, and other research institutions.
Many of our competitors have substantially greater financial, technical and other resources, such as larger research and development staff and experienced marketing and manufacturing organizations as well as established sales forces. Smaller or
early-stage companies may also prove to be significant competitors, particularly through collaborative arrangements with large, established companies. Mergers and acquisitions in the biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries may result in even
more resources being concentrated in our competitors. Competition may increase further as a result of advances in the commercial applicability of technologies and greater availability of capital for investment in these industries. Our competitors,
either alone or with collaborative partners, may succeed in developing, acquiring or licensing on an exclusive basis drug or biologic products that are more effective, safer, more easily commercialized, or less costly than our product candidates or
may develop proprietary technologies or secure patent protection that we may need for the development of our technologies and products. </P>
<P align="justify">
Specifically, we face significant competition from companies in the insulin therapy market.  Insulin therapy is widely used for Insulin-Dependent Diabetes Mellitus (IDDM) patients who are not controlled with oral medications. The global diabetes
market comprising the insulin, insulin analogues and other anti-diabetic drugs has been evolving rapidly. A look at the diabetes market reveals that it is dominated by a handful of participants such as Novo Nordisk A/S, Eli Lilly and Company,
Sanofi-Aventis, Takeda Pharmaceutical Company Limited, Pfizer Inc., Merck KgaA, and Bayer AG. Even if we obtain regulatory approval of our product candidates, we may not be the first to market and that may affect the price or demand for our product
candidates. Additionally, the availability and price of our competitors&rsquo; products could limit the demand and the price we are able to charge for our product candidates. We may not be able to implement our business plan if the acceptance of our
product candidates is inhibited by price competition or the reluctance of physicians to switch from existing methods of treatment to our product candidates, or if physicians switch to other new drug or biologic products or choose to reserve our
product candidates for use in limited circumstances.  Additionally, a competitor could obtain orphan product exclusivity from the FDA with respect to such competitor&rsquo;s product. If such competitor product is determined to be the same product as
one of our product candidates, that may prevent us from obtaining approval from the FDA for such product candidate for the same indication for seven years, except in limited circumstances.</P>

<B>We are highly dependent on our key personnel, and if we are not successful in attracting, motivating and retaining highly qualified personnel, we may not be able to successfully implement our business strategy. </B></P>
<P align="justify">
Our ability to compete in the highly competitive biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries depends upon our ability to attract, motivate and retain highly qualified managerial, scientific and medical personnel. We are highly dependent on our
management, particularly our chief science officer, Prof. Sarah Ferber, our chief executive officer, Vered Caplan and the chief executive officer of our U.S. Subsidiary, Scott Carmer. The loss of the services of any of our executive officers, other
key employees, and other scientific and medical advisors, and our inability to find suitable replacements, could result in delays in product development and harm our business. Competition for skilled personnel is intense and the turnover rate can be
high, which may limit our ability to hire and retain highly qualified personnel on acceptable terms or at all. </P>
<P align="justify">
To induce valuable employees to remain at our company, in addition to salary and cash incentives, we have provided stock option grants that vest over time. The value to employees of these equity grants that vest over time may be significantly
affected by movements in our stock price that are beyond our control, and may at any time be insufficient to counteract more lucrative offers from other companies. Although we have employment agreements with our key employees, these employment
agreements provide for at-will employment, which means that any of our employees could leave our employment at any time, with or without notice. We do not maintain &ldquo;key man&rdquo; insurance policies on the lives of all of these individuals or
the lives of any of our other employees. </P>
<P align="justify">
<B>We will need to grow the size and capabilities of our organization, and we may experience difficulties in managing this growth. </B></P>
<P align="justify">
As of November 30, 2014, we had 1 full-time employee and 6 part time employees.  As our development and commercialization plans and strategies develop, we must add a significant number of additional managerial, operational, sales, marketing,
financial, and other personnel.  Future growth will impose significant added responsibilities on members of management, including: </P>
<UL style="text-align:justify;">
<LI>
identifying, recruiting, integrating, maintaining, and motivating additional employees;</LI>

managing our internal development efforts effectively, including the clinical and FDA review process for our product candidates, while complying with our contractual obligations to contractors and other third parties; and</LI>

improving our operational, financial and management controls, reporting systems, and procedures.</LI>
</UL>
<P align="justify">
Our future financial performance and our ability to commercialize our product candidates will depend, in part, on our ability to effectively manage any future growth, and our management may also have to divert a disproportionate amount of its
attention away from day-to-day activities in order to devote a substantial amount of time to managing these growth activities. Our efforts to manage our growth are complicated by the fact that all of our executive officers other than our chief
executive officer have joined us since August 2014. This lack of long-term experience working together may adversely impact our senior management team&rsquo;s ability to effectively manage our business and growth. </P>
<P align="justify">
We currently rely, and for the foreseeable future will continue to rely, in substantial part on certain independent organizations, advisors and consultants to provide certain services. There can be no assurance that the services of these independent
organizations, advisors and consultants will continue to be available to us on a timely basis when needed, or that we can find qualified replacements.  In addition, if we are unable to effectively manage our outsourced activities or if the quality
or accuracy of the services provided by consultants is compromised for any reason, our clinical trials may be extended, delayed, or terminated, and we may not be able to obtain regulatory approval of our product candidates or otherwise advance our
business. There can be no assurance that we will be able to manage our existing consultants or find other competent outside contractors and consultants on economically reasonable terms, if at all. If we are not able to effectively expand our
organization by hiring new employees and expanding our groups of consultants and contractors, we may not be able to successfully implement the tasks necessary to further develop and commercialize our product candidates and, accordingly, may not
achieve our research, development, and commercialization goals. </P>

We may form or seek strategic alliances, create joint ventures or collaborations, or enter into additional licensing arrangements with third parties that we believe will complement or augment our development and commercialization efforts with
respect to our product candidates and any future product candidates that we may develop. Any of these relationships may require us to incur non-recurring and other charges, increase our near and long-term expenditures, issue securities that dilute
our existing stockholders, or disrupt our management and business. In addition, we face significant competition in seeking appropriate strategic partners and the negotiation process is time-consuming and complex. Moreover, we may not be successful
in our efforts to establish a strategic partnership or other alternative arrangements for our product candidates because they may be deemed to be at too early of a stage of development for collaborative effort and third parties may not view our
product candidates as having the requisite potential to demonstrate safety and efficacy.  Further, collaborations involving our product candidates, such as our collaborations with third-party research institutions, are subject to numerous risks,
which may include the following: </P>
<UL style="text-align:justify;">
<LI>
collaborators have significant discretion in determining the efforts and resources that they will apply to a collaboration;</LI>
<LI>
collaborators may not pursue development and commercialization of our product candidates or may elect not to continue or renew development or commercialization programs based on clinical trial results, changes in their strategic focus due to the
acquisition of competitive products, availability of funding, or other external factors, such as a business combination that diverts resources or creates competing priorities;</LI>
<LI>
collaborators may delay clinical trials, provide insufficient funding for a clinical trial, stop a clinical trial, abandon a product candidate, repeat or conduct new clinical trials, or require a new formulation of a product candidate for clinical
testing;</LI>
<LI>
collaborators could independently develop, or develop with third parties, products that compete directly or indirectly with our products or product candidates;</LI>
<LI>
a collaborator with marketing and distribution rights to one or more products may not commit sufficient resources to their marketing and distribution;</LI>
<LI>
collaborators may not properly maintain or defend our intellectual property rights or may use our intellectual property or proprietary information in a way that gives rise to actual or threatened litigation that could jeopardize or invalidate our
intellectual property or proprietary information or expose us to potential liability;</LI>
<LI>
disputes may arise between us and a collaborator that cause the delay or termination of the research, development or commercialization of our product candidates, or that result in costly litigation or arbitration that diverts management attention
and resources;</LI>
<LI>
collaborations may be terminated and, if terminated, may result in a need for additional capital to pursue further development or commercialization of the applicable product candidates; and</LI>
<LI>
collaborators may own or co-own intellectual property covering our products that results from our collaborating with them, and in such cases, we would not have the exclusive right to commercialize such intellectual property.</LI>
</UL>
<P align="justify">
As a result, if we enter into collaboration agreements and strategic partnerships or license our products or businesses, we may not be able to realize the benefit of such transactions if we are unable to successfully integrate them with our existing
operations and company culture, which could delay our timelines or otherwise adversely affect our business. We also cannot be certain that, following a strategic transaction or license, we will achieve the revenue or specific net income that
justifies such transaction. Any delays in entering into new collaborations or strategic partnership agreements related to our product candidates could delay the development and commercialization of our product candidates in certain geographies for
certain indications, which would harm our business prospects, financial condition, and results of operations. </P>

<P align="justify">We may evaluate various acquisitions and strategic partnerships, including licensing or acquiring complementary products, intellectual property rights, technologies, or businesses.  As more fully described in the section &ldquo;Subsequent
  Events&rdquo; in the footnotes to our financial statements, on November 6, 2014, we entered into a share exchange agreement with MaSTherCell SA and Cell Therapy Holding SA (collectively &ldquo;MaSTherCell&rdquo;) and each of the shareholders of
  MaSTherCell, which provides for the acquisition by our company of all of the issued and outstanding shares of MaSTherCell from the shareholders of MaSTherCell in exchange for the issuance of &#36;24,593,000 in value of shares of common stock in the

We face an inherent risk of product liability as a result of the clinical testing of our product candidates and will face an even greater risk if we commercialize any products. For example, we may be sued if our product candidates cause or are
perceived to cause injury or are found to be otherwise unsuitable during clinical testing, manufacturing, marketing or sale. Any such product liability claims may include allegations of defects in manufacturing, defects in design, a failure to warn
of dangers inherent in the product, negligence, strict liability or a breach of warranties. Claims could also be asserted under state consumer protection acts. If we cannot successfully defend ourselves against product liability claims, we may incur

<I>Risks Relating to Our Common Stock </I></P>
<P align="justify">
<B>If we issue additional shares in the future, it will result in the dilution of our existing stockholders. </B></P>
<P align="justify">
Our articles of incorporation authorize the issuance of up to 1,750,000,000 shares of our common stock with a par value of &#36;0.0001 per share. Our board of directors may choose to issue some or all of such shares to acquire one or more companies
or products and to fund our overhead and general operating requirements. The issuance of any such shares will reduce the book value per share and may contribute to a reduction in the market price of the outstanding shares of our common stock. If we
issue any such additional shares, such issuance will reduce the proportionate ownership and voting power of all current stockholders. Further, such issuance may result in a change of control of our company. </P>
<P align="justify">
<B>Trading of our stock is restricted by the Securities Exchange Commission&rsquo;s penny stock regulations, which may limit a stockholder&rsquo;s ability to buy and sell our common stock. </B></P>
<P align="justify">
The Securities and Exchange Commission has adopted regulations which generally define &ldquo;penny stock&rdquo; to be any equity security that has a market price (as defined) less than &#36;5.00 per share or an exercise price of less than &#36;5.00
per share, subject to certain exceptions.  Our securities are covered by the penny stock rules, which impose additional sales practice requirements on broker-dealers who sell to persons other than established customers and &ldquo;accredited
investors&rdquo;.  The term &ldquo;accredited investor&rdquo; refers generally to institutions with assets in excess of &#36;5,000,000 or individuals with a net worth in excess of &#36;1,000,000 or annual income exceeding &#36;200,000 or
&#36;300,000 jointly with their spouse. The penny stock rules require a broker-dealer, prior to a transaction in a penny stock not otherwise exempt from the rules, to deliver a standardized risk disclosure document in a form prepared by the
Securities and Exchange Commission, which provides information about penny stocks and the nature and level of risks in the penny stock market. The broker-dealer also must provide the customer with current bid and offer quotations for the penny
stock, the compensation of the broker-dealer and its salesperson in the transaction and monthly account statements showing the market value of each penny stock held in the customer&rsquo;s account. The bid and offer quotations, and the broker-dealer
and salesperson compensation information, must be given to the customer orally or in writing prior to effecting the transaction and must be given to the customer in writing before or with the customer&rsquo;s confirmation. In addition, the penny
stock rules require that prior to a transaction in a penny stock not otherwise exempt from these rules, the broker-dealer must make a special written determination that the penny stock is a suitable investment for the purchaser and receive the
purchaser&rsquo;s written agreement to the transaction.  These disclosure requirements may have the effect of reducing the level of trading activity in the secondary market for the stock that is subject to these penny stock rules. Consequently,
these penny stock rules may affect the ability of broker-dealers to trade our securities. We believe that the penny stock rules discourage investor interest in and limit the marketability of our common stock. </P>
<P align="justify">
<B>FINRA sales practice requirements may also limit a stockholder&rsquo;s ability to buy and sell our stock. </B></P>
<P align="justify">
In addition to the &ldquo;penny stock&rdquo; rules described above, the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (&ldquo;FINRA&rdquo;) has adopted rules that require that in recommending an investment to a customer, a broker-dealer must have
reasonable grounds for believing that the investment is suitable for that customer.  Prior to recommending speculative low priced securities to their non-institutional customers, broker-dealers must make reasonable efforts to obtain information
about the customer&rsquo;s financial status, tax status, investment objectives and other information. Under interpretations of these rules, FINRA believes that there is a high probability that speculative low priced securities will not be suitable
for at least some customers. FINRA requirements make it more difficult for broker-dealers to recommend that their customers buy our common stock, which may limit your ability to buy and sell our stock and have an adverse effect on the market for our stock. </P>

<i>Registration Rights </i></P>
<P align="justify">On May 6, 2013, we entered into a subscription agreement with Pall Life Science Belgium BVBA (formerly ATMI BVBA) (&ldquo;Pall&rdquo;), pursuant to which Pall purchased 1,526,718 units of our securities at a price of &#36;0.8515 per unit for total
  consideration of &#36;1,300,000. Each unit consists of one share of our common stock and one common share purchase warrant. Each warrant may be exercised pursuant to the terms of the warrant certificate for a period of two years from issuance at an
  exercise price of &#36;1.00, subject to adjustments as set out in the warrant certificate. In connection with the subscription agreement, we also entered into a registration rights agreement dated May 6, 2013, whereby we agree to provide notice to
  Pall that we will register their shares if we file a registration statement with the Securities and Exchange. </P>
<P align="justify">
On December 13, 2013, we entered into an investment agreement (the &ldquo;Investment Agreement&rdquo;) with Kodiak. Although we are not mandated to sell shares under the Investment Agreement, the Investment Agreement gives us the option to sell to
Kodiak, up to &#36;3,000,000 worth of our common stock over a twelve-month period.  The &#36;3,000,000 was stated as the total amount of available funding in the Investment Agreement because this was the maximum amount that Kodiak agreed to offer us
in funding. There is no assurance that the market price of our common stock will remain at its current price or increase substantially in the future. The number of common shares that remains issuable may not be sufficient, dependent upon the share
price, to allow us to access the full amount contemplated under the Investment Agreement. Therefore, we may not have access to the remaining commitment under Investment Agreement unless the market price of our common stock remains at its current
price or increases from its current level. On January 7, 2014, we filed a registration statement for 8,000,000 shares issuable pursuant to the Investment Agreement. </P>
<P align="justify">
On March 28, 2014 and on June 11, 2014, we filed prospectuses pursuant to Rule 424(b)(3), which are part of a registration statement filed by the Company with the SEC.  Under the prospectuses, the selling stockholders identified in the prospectuses
may offer and sell up to 10,603,436 shares of the Company&rsquo;s common stock, which will consist of: (i) up to 250,000 shares of common stock issued or to be issued to Kodiak as commitment shares pursuant to common stock purchase agreement dated
December 13, 2013 and up to 7,300,000 shares of common stock to be sold by Kodiak pursuant to the common stock purchase agreement; (ii) 1,526,718 shares of common stock issued to Pall ; and (iii) up to 1,526,718 shares of common stock that may be
issued upon the exercise of warrants issued to Pall. The 7,550,000 shares of common stock registered for resale by Kodiak represented 14% of the Company&rsquo;s issued and outstanding shares of common stock as of March 5, 2014. The selling
stockholders may sell all or a portion of the shares being offered pursuant to the prospectuses at fixed prices, at prevailing market prices at the time of sale, at varying prices or at negotiated prices. </P>
<P align="justify">
<I>Dividends </I></P>
<P align="justify">
We have never declared or paid any cash dividends on our common stock. We currently intend to retain future earnings, if any, to increase our working capital and do not anticipate paying any cash dividends in the foreseeable future. </P>
<P align="justify">
In the event that we obtain authorization to issue any preferred stock and issue such stock, we must not declare, pay or set apart for payment any dividend or other distribution (unless payable solely in shares of our common stock or other class of
stock junior to our preferred stock as to dividends or upon liquidation) in respect of our common stock, nor must we redeem, purchase or otherwise acquire for consideration shares of any of the foregoing, unless dividends, if any, payable to holders
of our preferred stock for the current period (and in the case of cumulative dividends, if any, payable to holders of our preferred stock for the current period and in the case of cumulative dividends, if any, for all past periods) have been paid,
are being paid or have been set aside for payment, in accordance with the terms of our preferred stock, as fixed by our board of directors. </P>
<P align="justify">
Other than as stated above, there are no restrictions in our articles of incorporation or bylaws that prevent us from declaring dividends. The Nevada Revised Statutes, however, do prohibit us from declaring dividends where, after giving effect to
the distribution of the dividend: </P>

we would not be able to pay our debts as they become due in the usual course of business; or</LI>

In December 2012, the Company entered into a subscription agreement with Derby for the issuance of 500,000 units for a total consideration of &#36;500,000. Each unit is comprised of one share of the Company&rsquo;s common stock and two
non-transferrable warrants. In connection with this agreement, the 1,000,000 warrants issued to Derby were expired on November 30, 2014. </P>

In May 2013, the Company entered into a subscription agreement with Pall, pursuant to which Pall purchased 1,526,718 units at a price of &#36;0.8515 per unit for total consideration of &#36;1,300,000. Each unit consisted of one share of the
Company&rsquo;s common stock and one warrant. On March 28, 2014, on June 11, 2014 and on July 31, 2014, the Company filed prospectuses pursuant to Rule 424(b)(3), which are part of a registration statement filed by the Company with the SEC, covering
the shares under the subscription agreement, which allows Pall to sell the shares (including shares that will be issued to Pall as a result of the exercise of the warrants). </P>
<P align="justify">
On December 13, 2013, the Company entered into a &#36;3,000,000 common stock purchase agreement with Kodiak Capital Group, LLC, a Newport Beach-based institutional investor (&ldquo;Kodiak&rdquo;).  The purchase agreement is conditioned, among other
things, by filing a registration statement with the SEC covering the shares that may be issued to Kodiak under the terms of the common stock purchase agreement.  After the SEC has declared the registration statement related to the transaction
effective (March 18, 2014; See below), the Company has the right at its sole discretion over a period of one year to sell shares of common stock under the terms set forth in the agreement in the total amount of up to &#36;3,000,000. Proceeds from
this transaction will be used to fund research and development and working capital.  Pursuant to the common stock purchase agreement, the Company issued to Kodiak 250,000 shares of common stock of the Company at no consideration. The Company valued
the shares at their fair value of &#36;135,000 and recorded the charge as financing cost. The Company&rsquo;s ability to put shares to Kodiak and obtain funds under the equity line is limited by the terms and conditions in the common stock purchase
agreement, including restrictions on when the Company may exercise its put rights, restrictions on the amount the Company may put to Kodiak at any one time, which is determined in part by the trading volume of the Company&rsquo;s common stock, and a
limitation on its ability to put shares to Kodiak. </P>
<P align="justify">
During the first quarter of 2014, the Company issued 1,128,849 units in a non-brokered private placement for total consideration of &#36;587,001.  Each unit consisted of one share of the Company&rsquo;s common stock and one non-transferable common
share purchase warrant, with each warrant entitling the holder to acquire one additional share of the Company&rsquo;s common stock at an exercise price of &#36;0.52 per share for a period of three years. In July 2014, 96,154 warrants were exercised.

During 2014, the Company issued 836,538 units at a purchase price of &#36;0.52 to investors in non-brokered private placements for a total consideration of &#36;385,000. Each unit consisted of one share of the Company&rsquo;s common stock and one

<P align=justify>The increase in salaries and related expenses and in
stock-based compensation in the twelve months ended November 30, 2014, compared
to the same period last year is mainly due to a change in the mix of employees
from general and administrative to research and development activities. The
increase in lab expenses during the twelve months ended November 30, 2014,
compared to the same period last year is related to expansion of research and
development operations in 2014, mainly in our Belgian Subsidiary. The grant
deduction is due to a grant approved from DGO6 in our Belgian Subsidiary for our
research and development activities in November 2014. </P>

to represent the fair value of 250,000 shares of common stock issued to Kodiak

<P align=justify>The increase in current assets is mainly due to an increase in
cash from the investment from Nine Investments Limited totaling $1,500,000 and a
grant in amount of $810,516 received in the Belgian Subsidiary during the twelve
months ended November 30, 2014. The increase in current liabilities was due to
an increase in expenses which resulted in an increase of accounts payable,
accrued expenses and employees and related payables of $1,404,598 during the
twelve months ended November 30, 2014, in addition to an increase in convertible
loans and accrued interest of $2,173,318. </P>

<P align=justify>The decrease in net cash used in operating activities in the
twelve months ended November 30, 2014, compared to the same period last year is
mainly related to the increase in our current liabilities such as accounts
payable, accrued expenses and employees and related payables during the twelve
month period ended November 30, 2014, compared to the same period last year.
This amount was offset by an increase in payable and receivable on account of
grant due to grants which received in the Belgian and U.S Subsidiaries. The
increase in cash provided by financing activities in the twelve months ended
November 30, 2014 compared to the comparable period in 2013 is mainly due to an
increase in convertible loans of $1,500,000 which was offset by a decrease in
capital received through sales of common stock and warrants. </P>
<P align=justify><I>Recent Corporate Developments </I></P>
<P align=justify>Since the commencement of the year through November 30, 2014,
we experienced the following corporate developments: </P>
<P align=justify><B>Private Placement </B></P>
<P align=justify>During the first quarter of 2014, the Company issued 1,128,849
units in a non-brokered private placement for total consideration of $587,001.
Each unit consisted of one share of the Company&#146;s common stock and one
non-transferable common share purchase warrant, with each warrant entitling the
holder to acquire one additional share of the Company&#146;s common stock at an
exercise price of $0.52 per share for a period of three years. </P>
<P align=justify><B>Convertible Loans with Mediapark A.G. </B></P>
<P align=justify>On March 22, 2013, we entered into a convertible loan agreement
with Mediapark A.G., a Marshall Islands company (&#147;Mediapark&#148;), pursuant to which
Mediapark purchased an 8% unsecured convertible debenture (the &#147;Convertible
Loan&#148;) in the aggregate principal amount of $250,000. On December 6, 2013, we
entered into a similar convertible loan agreement with Mediapark in the
aggregate principal amount of $100,000. The agreement stated that if we complete
an equity financing prior to the maturity date of the loan in an amount greater
than $350,000, Mediapark would convert all of our outstanding indebtedness into
equity securities on the same terms as the current financing. Due to meeting
this provision, on March 3, 2014, both loans in the aggregate amount of $370,772
(principle and interest) outstanding as of that date were converted into 713,023
shares of common stock at a price of $0.52 and 713,023 warrants to acquire
additional shares of our common stock at a price of $0.52 per share for a period
of three years in full payment of our indebtedness. The warrants were recorded
as financial expenses. </P>

On June 30, 2014, the Company&rsquo;s Subsidiary, Orgenesis Maryland, Inc., entered into a grant agreement with Maryland Technology Development Corporation (&ldquo;TEDCO&rdquo;).  TEDCO was created by the Maryland State Legislature in 1998 to
facilitate the transfer and commercialization of technology from Maryland&rsquo;s research universities and federal labs into the marketplace and to assist in the creation and growth of technology-based businesses in all regions of the State. TEDCO
is an independent organization that strives to be Maryland&rsquo;s lead source for entrepreneurial business assistance and seed funding for the development of startup companies in Maryland&rsquo;s innovation economy. TEDCO administers the Maryland
Stem Cell Research Fund to promote State-funded stem cell research and cures through financial assistance to public and private entities within the State. Under the agreement, TEDCO has agreed to give the Subsidiary an amount not to exceed
&#36;406,431 (the &ldquo;Grant&rdquo;). The Grant will be used solely to finance the costs to conduct the research project entitled &ldquo;Autologous Insulin Producing (AIP) Cells for Diabetes&rdquo; during a period of two years. On July 22, 2014,
the Subsidiary received an advance payment of &#36;203,216 on account of the grant. Through November 30, 2014, an amount of &#36;118,305 out of the &#36;203,216 was spent.  The amount of grant that was spent through November 30, 2014 was recorded as

<I>Going Concern </I></P>
<P align="justify">
The audited consolidated financial statements contained in this annual report on Form 10-K have been prepared assuming that the Company will continue as a going concern. The Company have accumulated losses for the period from inception (June 5,
2008) through November 30, 2014, of &#36;16,179,076 as well as negative cash flows from operating activities. Presently, the Company does not have sufficient cash resources to meet its plans in the twelve months following November 30, 2014.  These
factors raise substantial doubt about the Company&rsquo;s ability to continue as a going concern. Management is in the process of evaluating various financing alternatives in order to finance our research and development activities and general and
administrative expenses. These alternatives include raising funds through public or private equity markets and either through institutional or retail investors. Although there is no assurance that the Company will be successful with our fund raising
initiatives, management believes that the Company will be able to secure the necessary financing as a result of ongoing financing discussions with third party investors and existing shareholders. </P>
<P align="justify">
The consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments that may be necessary should the Company be unable to continue as a going concern. The Company&rsquo;s continuation as a going concern is dependent on its ability to obtain
additional financing as may be required and ultimately to attain profitability.  If the Company raises additional funds through the issuance of equity, the percentage ownership of current shareholders could be reduced, and such securities might have
rights, preferences or privileges senior to its common stock. Additional financing may not be available upon acceptable terms, or at all. If adequate funds are not available or are not available on acceptable terms, the Company may not be able to
take advantage of prospective business endeavors or opportunities, which could significantly and materially restrict its future plans for developing its business and achieving commercial revenues. If the Company is unable to obtain the necessary
capital, the Company may have to cease operations. </P>

<P align=justify>As more fully described in Note 2 to our financial statements
herein, on November 6, 2014, we entered into a share exchange agreement with
MasTHerCell and each of the shareholders of MaSTherCell, which provides for the
acquisition by our company of all of the issued and outstanding shares of
MaSTherCell from the shareholders of MaSTherCell in exchange for the issuance of
$24,593,000 in value of shares of common stock in the capital of our company.
MasTHerCell SA and Cell Therapy Holding SA are private limited liability
companies incorporated in Belgium, are generating limited revenue and are not
profitable. While the above cash requirements do contemplate our expected cash
needs for the scale-up of manufacturing for our products in the U.S. Market in
conjunction with MaSTherCell, they do not contemplate the potential cash needs
of MaSTherCell&#146;s current operations in their existing markets once acquired by
us. </P>
<P align=justify><I>Future Financing </I></P>
<P align=justify>We will require additional funds to implement our growth
strategy for our business. In addition, while we have received various grants
that have enabled us to fund our clinical developments, these funds are largely
restricted for use for other corporate operational and working capital purposes.
Therefore, we will need to raise additional capital to both supplement our
clinical developments that are not covered by any grant funding and to cover our
operational expenses. These funds may be raised through equity financing, debt
financing, or other sources, which may result in further dilution in the equity
ownership of our shares. There can be no assurance that additional financing
will be available to us when needed or, if available, that it can be obtained on
commercially reasonable terms. If we are not able to obtain the additional
financing on a timely basis should it be required, or generate significant
material revenues from operations, we will not be able to meet our other
obligations as they become due and we will be forced to scale down or perhaps
even cease our operations. </P>
<P align=justify><I>Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements </I></P>
<P align=justify>We have no off-balance sheet arrangements that have or are
reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial condition,
changes in financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations,
liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources that is material to
stockholders. </P>
<P align=justify><I>Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates </I></P>
<P align=justify>Our significant accounting policies are more fully described in
the notes to our consolidated financial statements included herein for the
fiscal year ended November 30, 2014. We believe that the accounting policies
below are critical for one to fully understand and evaluate our financial
condition and results of operations. </P>

<P align=justify><B>Research and Development </B></P>
<P align=justify>Research and development expenses include costs directly
attributable to the conduct of research and development programs, including the
cost of salaries, stock-based compensation expenses, payroll taxes and other
employees' benefits, lab expenses, consumable equipment and consulting fees. All
costs associated with research and developments are expensed as incurred. </P>
<P align=justify><B>Fair Value Measurement </B></P>
<P align=justify>The fair value measurement guidance clarifies that fair value
is an exit price, representing the amount that would be received to sell an
asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market
participants. As such, fair value is a market-based measurement that should be
determined based on assumptions that market participants would use in the
valuation of an asset or liability. It establishes a fair value hierarchy that
prioritizes the inputs to valuation techniques used to measure fair value. The
hierarchy gives the highest priority to unadjusted quoted prices in active
markets for identical assets or liabilities (Level 1 measurements) and the
lowest priority to unobservable inputs (Level 3 measurements). The three levels
of the fair value hierarchy under the fair value measurement guidance are
described below:</P>
<P align=justify><I>Level 1</I> - Unadjusted quoted prices in active markets
that are accessible at the measurement date for identical assets or
liabilities;</P>
<P align=justify><I>Level 2</I> - Quoted prices in markets that are not active,
or inputs that are observable, either directly or indirectly, for substantially
the full term of the asset or liability; or </P>
<P align=justify><I>Level 3</I> - Prices or valuation techniques that require
inputs that are both significant to the fair value measurement and unobservable
(supported by little or no market activity).</P>
<P align=justify><B>Embedded Derivatives </B></P>
<P align=justify>The Company entered into convertible debentures agreement in
which a derivative instrument is &#147;embedded&#148;. Embedded derivative is separated
from the host contract and carried at fair value when (1) the embedded
derivative possesses economic characteristics that are not clearly and closely
related to the economic characteristics of the host contract and (2) a separate,
stand-alone instrument with the same terms would qualify as a derivative
instrument. As to embedded derivatives arising from the issuance of convertible
debentures, see Note 4(b). </P>
<P align=justify><B>Volatility in Stock-Based Compensation </B></P>
<P align=justify>The volatility is based on historical volatilities of companies
in comparable stages as well as the historical volatility of companies in the
industry and, by statistical analysis of the daily share-pricing model. The
volatility of stock-based compensation granted after November 30, 2013 is based
on historical volatility of the Company for the last two years.</P>
<P align=justify><B>Warrants classified as liabilities </B></P>
<P align=justify>Warrants that entitle the holder to down-round protection
(through ratchet and anti-dilution provisions) are classified as liabilities in
the statement of financial position. The liability is measured both initially
and in subsequent periods at fair value, with changes in fair value charged to
finance expenses, net. </P>
<P align=justify>The fair value of the warrants is determining by using a Monte
Carlo type model based on a risk neutral approach. The model takes as an input
the estimated future dates when new capital will be raised, and builds a
multi-step dynamic model. The first step is to model the risk neutral
distribution of the share value on the new issue dates, then for each path to
use the Black-Scholes model to estimate the value of the warrants on the last
issue date including all the changes in exercise price and quantity along this
path. The significant unobservable input used in the fair value measurement is the future expected issue dates. Significant
delay in this input would result a higher fair value measurement. </P>

</B></P>
<P align=center>To the Shareholders of </P>
<P align=center><B>ORGENESIS INC. </B></P>
<P align=justify>We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of
Orgenesis Inc. and its subsidiaries (the &#147;Company&#148;) as of November 30, 2014 and
2013, and the related consolidated statements of comprehensive loss, changes in
capital deficiency and cash flows for each of the years then ended. These
financial statements are the responsibility of the Company's management. Our
responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based on
our audit.</P>
<P align=justify>We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the
Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards
require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about
whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. An audit
includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and
disclosures in the financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the
accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well
as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our
audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion. </P>
<P align=justify>In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred
to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the
Company and its subsidiaries at November 30, 2014 and 2013, and the results of
their comprehensive loss, changes in capital deficiency and cash flows for the
years then ended, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in
the United States of America. </P>
<P align=justify>As discussed in Note 1a to the financial statements, the
Company has recurring losses for the period from inception through November 30,
2014 and presently the Company does not have sufficient cash and other resources
to meet its requirements in the following twelve months. These factors raise
substantial doubt as to the Company's ability to continue as a going concern.
Management's plans in regard to these matters are also described in Note 1a. The
accompanying financial statements have been prepared assuming that the Company
will continue as a going concern and do not include any adjustments that might
result from the outcome of this uncertainty. </P>

<P align=justify>Orgenesis Inc. (&#147;the Company&#148;) was incorporated in the state of
Nevada on June 5, 2008. The Company is developing a technology that it is
bringing to the clinical stage that demonstrates the capacity to induce a shift
in the developmental fate of cells from the liver and differentiating
(converting) them into &#147;pancreatic beta cell like&#148; insulin producing cells for
patients with Type 1 Diabetes. </P>
<P align=justify>On October 11, 2011, the Company acquired a wholly owned
Subsidiary in Israel, Orgenesis Ltd. (the &#147;Israeli Subsidiary&#148;), which is
engaged in research and development. On February 2, 2012, the Israeli Subsidiary
entered into an agreement with Tel Hashomer Medical Research, Infrastructure and
Services Ltd (the &#147;Licensor&#148;). The Israeli Subsidiary was granted a worldwide,
royalty bearing, exclusive license to certain information regarding a molecular
and cellular approach directed at converting liver cells into functional insulin
producing cells, as treatment for diabetes. </P>
<P align=justify>On July 31, 2013, the Company incorporated a wholly owned
Subsidiary in Maryland, Orgenesis Maryland Inc. (the &#147;U.S. Subsidiary&#148;), which
is engaged in research and development. </P>
<P align=justify>On October 11, 2013, Orgenesis Ltd. incorporated a wholly owned
Subsidiary in Belgium, Orgenesis SPRL (the &#147;Belgian Subsidiary&#148;), which will be
engaged in development and manufacturing activities together with clinical
development studies in Europe, and later on to be the Company&#146;s center for the
Company's activities in Europe. </P>
<P align=justify>On November 6, 2014, the Company entered into a share exchange
agreement with MasTHerCell SA and Cell Therapy Holding SA (collectively
&#147;Masthercell&#148;) and each of the shareholders of Masthercell, which provides for
the acquisition by the Company of all of the issued and outstanding shares of
Masthercell from the shareholders of Masthercell in exchange for the issuance of
$24,593,000 in value of shares of common stock in the capital of the Company.
Masthercell is a private limited liability company incorporated in Belgium. Under the share exchange agreement, a
  total of $24,593,000 in value of common stock of Orgenesis is to be issued at the
  average of all closing trading prices for Orgenesis common shares as traded on
  the OTC stock market for the 30 trading days immediately preceding the closing
  date, but will be priced at no more than $0.80 and no less than $0.50. In the
  event that Orgenesis has not achieved a post-closing financing and a valuation
  which meets the agreed threshold within eight (8) months of the closing date,
  then the Masthercell shareholders may, by notice to Orgenesis, unwind the
  transaction in exchange for return of all of the Consideration Shares plus any
  amount that Orgenesis has advanced or invested in Masthercell. In the event that
  some or all of Masthercell&#146;s current outstanding convertible bonds are not
  converted to shares, the consideration payable in share of the Company's common
  stock will be reduced by the amount that is then owed to the Bondholders. The
  share exchange agreement contemplates that on or prior to the closing of the
  acquisition, the parties will conduct due diligence on each other and
  Masthercell will provide its audited financial statements, among other things.
  The closing of the share exchange agreement is subject to the satisfaction of
  certain conditions precedent, including (without limitation) receipt of legal
  opinions, there being no material changes in the affairs of either Orgenesis or
  Masthercell, all parties&#146; representations continuing to be true at closing, and
  other conditions which are listed in the Agreement. Due to conditions precedent
  to closing, including those set out above, and the risk that the conditions
  precedent may not be satisfied, there is no assurance that the Company will
  close the share exchange agreement and complete the acquisition of all of the
  issued and outstanding shares of Masthercell. </P>
<P align=justify>Unless otherwise indicated, the term &#147;Company&#148; refer to
Orgenesis Inc. and its wholly owned Subsidiaries. As of the date of this filing,
the foregoing terms do not include Masthercell. Unless otherwise specified, all
dollar amounts are expressed in United States dollars. </P>
<P align=justify>On November 17, 2014, the Company's Belgian Subsidiary received
the formal approval from the Walloon Region, Belgium (Service Public of
Wallonia, DGO6) for a &euro;2.015 million (approximately $2.5 million) support
program for the research and development of a potential cure for Type 1
Diabetes. The grants are subject to certain conditions with respect to the
Company's work in the Walloon Region, the Company's own investment in these
projects and certain other conditions. On December 9 and 16, 2014, the Company's received &euro;651,000 and &euro;558,000 under the grant, respectively. </P>

<P align="justify">On December 21, 2014, the Company's Israeli Subsidiary received a notification from the Israel-U.S. Binational Industrial Research and Development Foundation (&ldquo;BIRD&rdquo;) that the Company's Israeli Subsidiary and the Company's research and
development partner, have been approved by BIRD's Board of Governors for a conditional grant of &#36;800,000 for a joint research and development project for the use Autologous Insulin Producing (AIP) Cells for the Treatment of Diabetes (the
&ldquo;Project&rdquo;). Up to the date of this report, the Company has not yet received these funds. </P>
<P align="justify">
<B>Going Concern and Management&rsquo;s Plan </B></P>
<P align="justify">
The accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared assuming that the Company will continue as a going concern. The Company has net losses for the period from inception (June 5, 2008) through November 30, 2014, of &#36;16,179,076,
as well as  negative cash flows from operating activities. Presently, the Company does not have sufficient cash resources to meet its plans in the twelve months following November 30, 2014. These factors raise substantial doubt about the Company's
ability to continue as a going concern. Management is in the process of evaluating various financing alternatives for operations, as the Company will need to finance future research and development activities and general and administrative expenses
through fund raising in the public or private equity markets.</P>
<P align="justify">
The consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments that may be necessary should the Company be unable to continue as a going concern. The Company&rsquo;s continuation as a going concern is dependent on its ability to obtain
additional financing as may be required and ultimately to attain profitability.  If the Company raises additional funds through the issuance of equity, the percentage ownership of current shareholders could be reduced, and such securities might have
rights, preferences or privileges senior to its common stock. Additional financing may not be available upon acceptable terms, or at all. If adequate funds are not available or are not available on acceptable terms, the Company may not be able to
take advantage of prospective business endeavors or opportunities, which could significantly and materially restrict its future plans for developing its business and achieving commercial revenues. If the Company is unable to obtain the necessary
capital, the Company may have to cease operations. </P>
<P align="justify">
<I>b.</I><I> </I><I><U>Use of Estimates in the Preparation of Financial Statements</U></I><I> </I></P>
<P align="justify">
The preparation of the consolidated financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and
liabilities at the financial statements date and the reported expenses during the reporting periods. Actual results could differ from those estimates. As applicable to these consolidated financial statements, the most significant estimates and
assumptions relate to the valuation of stock based compensation, embedded derivatives and warrants issued. </P>
<P align="justify">
<I>c.</I><I> </I><I><U>Cash equivalents</U></I><I> </I></P>

<P align="justify">
The currency of the primary economic environment in which the operations of the Company and part of its Subsidiaries are conducted is in the U.S. dollar (&ldquo;&#36;&rdquo; or &ldquo;dollar&rdquo;). The functional currency of the Belgian
Subsidiary, which has only commenced operations, is the Euro (&ldquo;&euro;&rdquo; or &ldquo;Euro&rdquo;). Most of the Company&rsquo;s expenses are incurred in dollars and the source of the Company&rsquo;s financing has been provided in dollars.
Thus, the functional currency of the Company and its Subsidiaries is the dollar. Transactions and balances originally denominated in dollars are presented at their original amounts. Balances in foreign currencies are translated into dollars using
historical and current exchange rates for nonmonetary and monetary balances, respectively. For foreign transactions and other items reflected in the statements of operations, the following exchange rates are used: (1) for transactions &ndash;
exchange rates at transaction dates or average rates and (2) for other items (derived from nonmonetary balance sheet items such as depreciation) &ndash; historical exchange rates.  The resulting transaction gains or losses are carried to financial
income or expenses, as appropriate. </P>

<P align="justify">
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1) With respect to deferred taxes, income taxes are computed using the asset and liability method. Under the asset and liability method, deferred income tax assets and liabilities are determined based on the differences
between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities and are measured using the currently enacted tax rates and laws. A valuation allowance is recognized to the extent that it is more likely than not that the deferred taxes will
not be realized in the foreseeable future. It is the Company&rsquo;s policy to classify interest and penalties on income taxes as interest expense or penalties expense. The Company have provided a full valuation allowance with respect to its
deferred tax assets. </P>
<P align="justify">
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2) The Company follow a two-step approach to recognizing and measuring uncertain tax positions. The first step is to evaluate the tax position for recognition by determining if the available evidence indicates that it
is more likely than not that the position will be sustained on examination. If this threshold is met, the second step is to measure the tax position as the largest amount that is greater than 50% likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement.
</P>
<P align="justify">
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3) Taxes that would apply in the event of disposal of investment in Subsidiaries have not been taken into account in computing the deferred income taxes, as it is the Company&rsquo;s intent and ability to hold these
investments. </P>

The Company account for employee stock based compensation in accordance with the guidance of ASC Topic 718, Compensation which requires all share based payments to employees, including grants of employee stock options, to be recognized in the
financial statements based on their grant date fair values.  The fair value of the equity instrument is charged to compensation expense and credited to additional paid in capital over the period during which services are rendered. </P>

The Company follow ASC Topic 505-50, for stock options and warrants issued to consultants and other non-employees. In accordance with ASC Topic 505-50, these stock options issued as compensation for services provided to the Company are accounted for

</I></P>
<P align=justify>The fair value measurement guidance clarifies that fair value
is an exit price, representing the amount that would be received to sell an
asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market
participants. As such, fair value is a market-based measurement that should be
determined based on assumptions that market participants would use in the
valuation of an asset or liability. It establishes a fair value hierarchy that
prioritizes the inputs to valuation techniques used to measure fair value. The
hierarchy gives the highest priority to unadjusted quoted prices in active
markets for identical assets or liabilities (Level 1 measurements) and the
lowest priority to unobservable inputs (Level 3 measurements). The three levels
of the fair value hierarchy under the fair value measurement guidance are
described below:</P>
<P align=justify><I>Level 1 </I>Unadjusted quoted prices in active markets that
are accessible at the measurement date for identical assets or liabilities;</P>
<P align=justify><I>Level 2 </I>Quoted prices in markets that are not active, or
inputs that are observable, either directly or indirectly, for substantially the
full term of the asset or liability; or </P>
<P align=justify><I>Level 3 </I>Prices or valuation techniques that require
inputs that are both significant to the fair value measurement and unobservable
(supported by little or no market activity).</P>

period of three years. The fair value of these warrants as of the date of issuance was &#36;117,047 using the Black-Scholes valuation model based on the following assumptions: dividend yield of 0% for all years; expected volatility of 102%; risk
free interest of 0.91%, and an expected life of three years.</P>

&#36;50,000. As an inducement to the investor to exercise the warrants, the Company issued the investor twice the number of warrants exercised, which was 192,308 new warrants, with each warrant entitling the holder to acquire one additional share of
the Company&rsquo;s common stock at an exercise price of &#36;0.52 per share for a period of three years. The fair value of these warrants as of the date of issuance was &#36;60,023 using the Black-Scholes valuation model based on the following
assumptions: dividend yield of 0% for all years; expected volatility of 103%; risk free interest of 0.98%, and an expected life of three years. </P>

<P align=justify>In March 2013, the Company entered into a loan and warrant
subscription agreement with Mediapark A.G., a Marshall Islands Company
(&#147;Mediapark&#148;). The Company received a loan (the &#147;Mediapark Loan&#148;) in the total
amount of $250,000 and issued to Mediapark 100,000 warrants. Each warrant can be
exercised into one share of common stock at a purchase price of $0.50 per share
and is exercisable until March 22, 2015. See also Note 8(a). The warrants issued
are detachable from the Mediapark Loan and classified as a liability due to
downround protection (ratchet and anti-dilution provisions). Therefore the
Company allocated the proceeds from Mediapark, first to the warrants based upon
their fair value and the residual amount was allocated to the Mediapark Loan. As
of the issuance day of the warrants, the fair value of the warrants was $65,192
based on Monte Carlo simulation model. See also Note 8(a). </P>
<P align=justify>The Mediapark Loan bears interest at an annual rate of 8%,
which is calculated quarterly. The original maturity day of the Mediapark Loan
was June 30, 2013. The Company had the right to extend the maturity date for an
additional period of up to 90 days provided that it issues an additional 100,000
warrants (the &#147;Additional Warrants&#148;). </P>

If the Company has not paid the Mediapark Loan in full at the maturity date or, if extended, at the extended maturity date, Mediapark has the right of conversion in respect of the total outstanding amount of the principal balance including accrued
interest as of the conversion date into shares of common stock, at a price per share equal to the lower of: (i) &#36;0.75, and (ii) the value of the weighted average price of the share during the five trading days prior to the date of conversion.
</P>
<P align="justify">
On June 30, 2013 the Company exercised its discretion to extend the maturity date of the Mediapark Loan to September 30, 2013. In return for extending the maturity date, the Company issued to Mediapark additional 100,000 warrants at an exercise
price of &#36;0.50 per share, which subject to anti-dilution provisions, until June 30, 2015. The fair value of the warrants was &#36;48,800 based on Monte Carlo simulation model. See also Note 8(a). </P>
<P align="justify">
On September 30, 2013, the Company extended again the maturity date of Mediapark Loan to December 31, 2013. In return for extending the maturity date, the Company issued to Mediapark 100,000 warrants, which can be exercised into shares at an
exercise price of &#36;0.50 per share, which subject to anti-dilution provisions, until September 30, 2015. The fair value of the warrants was &#36;46,000 based on Monte Carlo simulation model. See also Note 8(a). </P>

On December 6, 2013, the Company entered into a new agreement on the Mediapark Loan, pursuant to which Mediapark purchased an 8% unsecured convertible debenture (the &ldquo;Mediapark Convertible Loan&rdquo;) in the aggregate principal amount of
&#36;100,000. Interest is calculated semiannually and is payable, along with the principal, on or before December 6, 2014.  According to the agreement, in the event that the Company completes an equity financing prior to the maturity date for gross
proceeds of &#36;350,000 or more, Mediapark will convert the Company&rsquo;s indebtedness under the Mediapark Loan and the Mediapark Convertible loan into shares of common stock and/or warrants on the same terms as the new equity financing. </P>

As a result of the issuance of 1,128,849 units described in Note 3(b)(4), the Mediapark Loan and the Convertible Loan described above in the aggregate amount of &#36;370,772 (including principal and interest) outstanding as of March 3, 2014 were
converted on that date to 713,023 shares of common stock of the Company at a conversion rate of &#36;0.52 per share and to 713,023 warrants to acquire additional shares of the Company&rsquo;s common stock at an exercise price of &#36;0.52 per share
for a period of three years. The fair value of these warrants as of the date of issuance was &#36;259,731 using the Black Scholes valuation model based on the following assumptions: dividend yield of 0% for all years; expected volatility of 104%;
risk free interest of 0.66%, and an expected life of three years. This amount recorded as financial expense. </P>

On May 29, 2014, the Company entered into a convertible loan agreement with Nine Investments Limited, a Hong Kong company (&ldquo;Nine Investments&rdquo;), pursuant to which Nine Investments loaned the Company &#36;1,500,000 which the Company
subsequently transferred to its Belgian Subsidiary, Orgenesis SPRL, to fund a research project to develop new medical technologies and cell therapies for the treatment of diabetes. The Company received the funds on June 4, 2014 (the &ldquo;Closing
Date&rdquo;). Interest is calculated at 8% semiannually and is payable, along with the principal on or before December 31, 2014 subject to acceleration for specific events including: (i) if a grant of money to Orgenesis SPRL is not approved by
Department De La Gestion Financiere Direction De L&rsquo;analyse Financiere (&ldquo;DGO6&rdquo;) within 90 days after the loan proceeds are advanced; and (ii) if the Company raises, in the aggregate, gross proceeds of more than &#36;400,000 between

<P align=justify>As consideration for entering into the loan agreement, on June
5, 2014, the Company issued to Nine Investments 500,000 shares of its common

<P align=justify>The Company allocated the proceeds from Nine Investments
between the shares and the convertible loan based on the relative fair value. In
addition, the conversion right is detachable from the loan and classified as a
derivative due to down round protection (full ratchet and anti-dilution
provisions). Therefore, the Company attributed, to the conversion right
derivative, out of the proceeds allocated to the convertible loan based on its

<P align=justify>The Company estimated the fair value of the embedded derivative
by using the Black-Sholes formula for option pricing using the following
parameters: Share price $0.50; Exercise price $0.40; Volatility 94%; Dividend
yield 0; Risk-free interest 0.05% and 80% likelihood for conversion. The bonus
shares component was recorded as additional paid-in-capital and the fair value
of the embedded derivative component is classified as a financial liability
because the conversion price and the number of shares of common stock
deliverable upon the conversion of the loan shall be subject to adjustment and
will be measured in subsequent periods at fair value with changes in fair value
charged to financial expenses or income, net. </P>

<P align=justify>In September 2014, the Company entered into convertible loans
agreements for $150,000. The loans bear an annual interest rate of 6% and mature
in six months, unless converted earlier. The lender shall have the right to
convert all or any portion of the outstanding principal amount and all accrued
but unpaid interest thereon into shares of common stock of the Company at a
conversion price of $0.40 per share. Since the stock price is greater than the
effective conversion price (after allocation of the total proceeds) on the
measurement date, the conversion features is considered "beneficial" to the
holders and equal to $135,000. The difference is treated as issued equity and
reduces the carrying value of the host debt; the discount is accreted as deemed
interest on the debt.</P>

the Company's board of directors from time to time. Under this plan, each option
is exercisable into one share of common stock of the Company. The options may be
exercised after vesting and in accordance with the vesting schedule that will be
determined by the Company's board of directors for each grant. The maximum
contractual life term of the options is 10 years. </P>

<P align=justify>The fair value of each stock option grant is estimated at the
date of grant using the Black-Scholes valuation model. The volatility is based
on historical volatilities of companies in comparable stages as well as the
historical volatility of companies in the industry and, by statistical analysis
of the daily share-pricing model. The volatility of stock-based compensation
granted after November 30, 2013 is based on historical volatility of the Company
for the last two years. The expected term is equal to the contractual life,
based on management estimation for the expected dates of exercising of the
options. The fair value of each option grant is estimated on the date of grant
using the Black Scholes option pricing model with the following assumptions:

granted an aggregate of 1,080,000 stock options to a consultant that are
exercisable at $0.50, with 216,000 vesting immediately and 216,000 for each of
the next four years and expire on August 1, 2018. The fair value of these
options as of the date of grant was $403,614 using the Black and Scholes option
valuation model.</P>
<P align=justify>The fair value of each stock option grant is estimated at the
date of grant using the Black-Scholes valuation model. The volatility is based
on historical volatilities of companies in comparable stages as well as the
historical volatility of companies in the industry and, by statistical analysis
of the daily share-pricing model. The volatility of stock-based compensation
granted after November 30, 2013 is based on historical volatility of the Company
for the last two years. The expected term is equal to the contractual life,
based on management estimation for the expected dates of exercising of the
options. The fair value of each option grant is estimated on the date of grant
using the Black Scholes option pricing model with the following assumptions:

entered into a consulting agreement with Aspen Agency Limited, a Hong Kong
corporation (&#147;Aspen&#148;), pursuant to which Aspen has agreed to provide investment
banking, investor relations and business development services to the Company. In
consideration for Aspen&#146;s services, the Company agreed to issue to Aspen
3,000,000 stock options in two separate tranches of 1,000,000 and 2,000,000,
with the second tranche vesting if they exercise the first tranche, to acquire
shares of the Company&#146;s common stock at an exercise price of $0.52 per share,
for a period of three years. The term of the consulting agreement was from April
3, 2014 and will run for an indefinite period unless terminated by either party
providing 30 days written notice. The fair value of the options was $744,000 and
was recorded as additional paid in capital in the balance sheet with a
corresponding expense in general and administrative expenses. On October 23,
2014, the Company entered into a termination agreement with Aspen in which both
parties agreed to terminate the consulting agreement and to cancel the first
tranche of options. By way of cancellation of the first tranche of options, the
second tranche was cancelled as well. The fair value of each option grant is
estimated on the date of grant using a hybrid model combining a Monte Carlo
simulation and Black Scholes option pricing model with the following
assumptions: </P>

<P align=justify>The fair value of each of the warrants described in Note 8(a)
is determined by using a Monte Carlo simulation model based on a risk neutral
approach. The model takes as an input the estimated future dates when new
capital will be raised, and builds a multistep dynamic model. The first step is
to model the risk neutral distribution of the share value on the new issuance dates. Then for each path to use the
Black-Scholes valuation model to estimate the value of the warrants on the last
issuance date including all the changes in exercise price and quantity along
this path. The significant unobservable input used in the fair value measurement
is the volatility and future expected issuance dates. </P>

<P align=justify>The fair value of the embedded derivative described in Note
4(b) is determined by using the Black-Scholes valuation model. Notwithstanding
the anti-dilution provision, the Black Scholes formula produces a value that is
substantially the same to the value under more flexible option valuation models
such as the Monte Carlo simulation model due to an ineffectiveness of this
protection feature over the relatively short term of the embedded derivative.

<P align=justify><I>Disclosure Controls and Procedures </I></P>
<P align=justify>We maintain disclosure controls and procedures that are
designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in our reports
filed under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, is recorded,
processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the
SEC&#146;s rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated
to our management, including our interim president and chief executive officer
(who is our principal executive officer) and our chief financial officer,
treasurer, and secretary (who is our principal financial officer and principal
accounting officer) to allow for timely decisions regarding required disclosure.
In designing and evaluating our disclosure controls and procedures, our
management recognizes that any controls and procedures, no matter how well
designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving the
desired control objectives, and our management is required to apply its judgment
in evaluating the costbenefit relationship of possible controls and procedures.
The ineffectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures was due to
material weaknesses identified in our internal control over financial reporting,
described below. </P>
<P align=justify><I>Management&#146;s Report on Internal Control over Financial
Reporting </I></P>
<P align=justify>Management is responsible for establishing and maintaining
adequate internal control over our financial reporting. In order to evaluate the
effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, as required by
Section 404 of the SarbanesOxley Act of 2002. Our management, with the
participation of our principal executive officer and principal financial officer
has conducted an assessment, including testing, using the criteria in Internal
Control Integrated Framework, issued by the Committee of Sponsoring
Organizations of the Treadway Commission (&#147;COSO&#148;) (2013). Our system of internal
control over financial reporting is designed to provide reasonable assurance
regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of
financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted
accounting principles. Because of its inherent limitations, internal control
over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. This
assessment included review of the documentation of controls, evaluation of the
design effectiveness of controls, testing of the operating effectiveness of
controls and a conclusion on this evaluation. Based on this evaluation, our
management concluded our internal control over financial reporting was not
effective as of November 30, 2014. The ineffectiveness of our internal control
over financial reporting was due to the following material weaknesses which are
indicative of many small companies with small staff: </P>

funds, remediation efforts may be adversely affected in a material manner.
Because of the inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of
controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues, if any, within
our company have been detected. These inherent limitations include the realities
that judgments in decisionmaking can be faulty and that breakdowns can occur
because of simple error or mistake. </P>

<I>Nominating Committee</I> </P>
<P align="justify">
Our board of directors is of the view that it is appropriate for us not to have a standing nominating committee because the current size of our board of directors does not facilitate the establishment of a separate committee. Our board of directors
has performed, and will perform adequately, the functions of a nominating committee.  The directors who perform the functions of a nominating committee are independent.  The determination of independence of directors has been made using the
definition of &ldquo;independent director&rdquo; contained under Rule 4200(a)(15) of the Rules of the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority. Our board of directors has not adopted a charter for the nomination committee.  There has not been any
defined policy or procedure requirements for stockholders to submit recommendations or nomination for directors. Our board of directors does not believe that a defined policy with regard to the consideration of candidates recommended by stockholders
is necessary at this time because we believe that, given the early stages of our development, a specific nominating policy would be premature and of little assistance until our business operations are at a more advanced level. There are no specific,
minimum qualifications that our board of directors believes must be met by a candidate recommended by our board of directors.  The process of identifying and evaluating nominees for director typically begins with our board of directors soliciting
professional firms and other industry professionals with whom we have an existing business relationship, such as law firms, accounting firms or financial advisory firms, for suitable candidates to serve as directors. It is followed by our board of
director&rsquo;s review of the candidates&rsquo; resumes and interview of candidates. Based on the information gathered, our board of directors then makes a decision on whether to recommend the candidates as nominees for director. We do not pay any
fee to any third party or parties to identify or evaluate or assist in identifying or evaluating potential nominees. Our company does not have any defined policy or procedural requirements for stockholders to submit recommendations or nominations
for directors. Our directors believe that, given the stage of our development, a specific nominating policy would be premature and of little assistance until our business operations develop to a more advanced level. </P>

<i>Compensation Discussion and Analysis </i></P>
<P align="justify">On February 2, 2012, we entered into a consultancy agreement with Weinberg Dalyo Inc. for financial consulting services for a consideration of &#36;3,000 per month. Weinberg Dalyo Inc. is owned by our former Chief Financial Officer, Mr. Weinberg.
  During the period of this agreement, if the consultant locates an investor, which we enter into a binding investment agreement, the consultant is entitled to a bonus of 2% from the total investment in cash. Due to additional work by Mr. Weinberg
  regarding the quarterly and annual filings of our company, due diligence with investors and financial work regarding fund raising, we increased the compensation payable to Mr. Weinberg as follows: on January 31, 2013, to &#36;9,000 per month, on
  April 30, 2013, to &#36;10,000 per month, on May 31, 2013, to &#36;11,000 per month, and on August 2013, to &#36;12,500 per month.  Mr. Weinberg resigned his position as CFO, Treasurer and Secretary on April 16, 2014. </P>
<P align="justify">
On February 2, 2012, we entered into an employment agreement (the &ldquo;Ferber Employment Agreement&rdquo;) with Prof. Sarah Ferber. Pursuant to the Ferber Employment Agreement, Prof. Ferber agreed to serve as our Chief Scientific Officer. Prof.
Ferber will be paid a gross salary of NIS (Israeli shekel) 36,000 per month, which is approximately &#36;9,572 based on an exchange rate of 1 NIS equals 0.2689 USD as of February 2, 2012. In the event we complete a financing of at least
&#36;1,000,000 (in addition to the &#36;1.5 million private placement in February 2012), Prof. Ferber&rsquo;s salary will double. Prof. Ferber agreed to spend 50% of her entire business time and attention to the business of our company. We also
granted Prof. Ferber stock options to purchase 2,781,905 shares of our common stock at a price per share equal to &#36;0.0001. Prof. Ferber&rsquo;s salary was increased to NIS 72,000 per month in May 2013. </P>
<P align="justify">
On March 14, 2012 we signed an employment agreement with Jacob BenArie, our former Chief Executive Officer to be effective from February 2, 2012. In return for acting as our Chief Executive Officer, we agreed to pay Mr. BenArie a fee of 40,000 New
Israeli Shekels per month; reimburse any of outofpocket expenses; and to grant 2,781,905 stock options at a price of US &#36;0.69 per option share. Mr. BenArie was eligible to receive bonuses based upon performance criteria to be determined by our
board of directors. Mr. BenArie was also entitled to receive a onetime incentive bonus in an amount of USD 10,000 to be paid within 14 days of the date of signing the employment agreement. </P>
<P align="justify">
On December 17, 2012, Mr. Jacob BenArie resigned as President and Chief Executive Officer.  There were no disagreements between Mr. BenArie and our company. Mr. BenArie retains his position as President and Chief Executive Officer of our Israeli
Subsidiary, Orgenesis Ltd., and resigned that position on October 31, 2014. </P>
<P align="justify">
On January 3, 2013, we executed an employment term sheet with Mr. Sav DiPasquale to act as our President and Chief Executive Officer to be effective December 17, 2012 in consideration for, among other things, an annual gross salary of
US&#36;180,000. On February 17, 2013 we executed an employment agreement with Sav DiPasquale to act as our President and Chief Executive Officer, which formalized the term sheet dated December 17, 2012. As part of his compensation he was to receive
stock options at an exercise price of &#36;0.001 per share upon the performance as follows: (i) 982,358 performance shares to be issued upon the completion of a fundraising and (ii) 1,473,537 stock options to be issued as to 25% on each of the
first, second, third and fourth anniversaries of the date of his employment agreement. The fair value of these shares as of the date of grant was &#36;869,387. On October 23, 2013, 255,413 performance options were granted to Mr. Dipasqale based on
his agreement. On December 23, 2013, Mr. DiPasquale, resigned. As a result of his resignation, all options that were not vested were forfeited. On January 2, 2014, the board of directors approved a grant of 368,393 options out of the 1,473,537
options mentioned above. The grant was based on Mr. DiPasquale&rsquo;s employment agreement. According to Mr. DiPasquale&rsquo;s employment agreement, all vested options expire 90 days after the date of termination of employment. On February 16,
2014, Mr. DiPasquale exercised 623,806 options at a price of &#36;0.001 per share. </P>
