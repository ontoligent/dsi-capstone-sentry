life-threating inflammatory-fibrotic diseases with clear unmet medical needs. Our product Resunab&#153;, or Resunab, is a novel oral anti-inflammatory drug that is expected to commence Phase-IIa clinical trials for the treatment of cystic fibrosis,
or CF, and scleroderma pending U.S. Food and Drug Administration, or FDA, approval of the Investigational New Drug Application for Resunab, which was filed with the scleroderma clinical protocol on February&nbsp;5, 2015. During the second quarter of
2015, we plan to submit to the FDA under the Resunab IND an additional clinical protocol for cystic fibrosis. We expect to commence clinical studies for both the scleroderma and cystic fibrosis indications during the second quarter of 2015. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Corbus Pharmaceuticals Inc. (formerly known as JB Therapeutics Inc.), was incorporated on April&nbsp;24, 2009 under the laws of the State of
Delaware. On April&nbsp;11, 2014, JB Therapeutics Inc. completed a merger with Corbus Pharmaceuticals Holdings Inc. and changed its name to Corbus Pharmaceuticals, Inc. Upon the consummation of the merger, Corbus Pharmaceuticals, Inc. became a
wholly owned subsidiary of Corbus Pharmaceuticals Holdings, Inc., or Corbus, which continues to operate the business of Corbus Pharmaceuticals, Inc. Since our inception, we have devoted substantially all of our efforts to business planning, research
and development, recruiting management and technical staff, acquiring operating assets and raising capital. Our research and development activities have included completing pre-clinical studies, the development of manufacturing methods and
manufacturing of our lead drug Resunab for clinical trials and the design of clinical protocols for human clinical studies. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Inflammation
is a natural defense mechanism carried out by our immune system to protect our bodies from infection and injury. However, under certain circumstances inflammation once triggered is unable to be resolved, resulting in a chronic inflammatory disease.
Since each organ in the body is capable of protecting itself from infection and injury by recruiting inflammatory cells to its site, each organ has the potential to suffer from excessive inflammation leading to inflammatory diseases that may cause
discomfort, pain, loss of organ function, disability or even death. There are hundreds of inflammatory diseases, many of which are chronic, life-long and incurable. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">A key aspect of the body&#146;s inflammatory response is the recruitment of inflammatory cells to the site of tissue infection/injury
whereupon these cells act to destroy the infection and/or repair tissue damage. The signaling pathway that modulates the inflammatory response involves the production of bioactive lipids termed eicosanoids by the enzymes cyclooxygenase, or COX, and
lysyl oxidase, or LOX, resulting in pro-inflammatory mediators as shown in the Figure 1 below. These mediators trigger the activation and maintenance of a cellular inflammatory state resulting in the further generation of pro-inflammatory mediators
termed cytokines. This fundamental pathway is involved in a wide spectrum of inflammatory diseases. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">While the onset of inflammation has
been well understood for some time, the mechanisms that resolve inflammation have only recently been discovered. This &#147;resolution pathway&#148; involves shifting the production of pro-inflammatory eicosanoids by the COX and LOX enzymes to the
production of anti-inflammatory eicosanoids. These anti-inflammatory eicosanoids act to resolve inflammation and promote tissue healing. The lack of sufficient inflammatory resolution is a key contributor to many chronic inflammatory diseases. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Resunab is a synthetic, rationally designed oral small molecule that selectively binds to CB2 receptors found on immune cells. The CB2
receptor plays a natural role in modulating and resolving inflammation by, in effect, turning inflammation &#147;off.&#148; Through activation of CB2, Resunab stimulates the production of anti-inflammatory mediators and causes a concomitant
reduction in pro-inflammatory mediators and cytokines. Because it acts through this natural resolving pathway, Resunab offers a new mechanism to potentially treat a wide spectrum of chronic inflammatory diseases in which the resolution of
inflammation (the &#147;off&#148; switch) fails to occur. </P>

in excessive tissue scarring, or fibrosis, that leads to organ failure and death. Examples of such chronic diseases include cystic fibrosis, scleroderma, liver cirrhosis and non-alcoholic steatohepatitis, or NASH, chronic kidney disease, muscular
dystrophies, rheumatoid arthritis, systemic lupus erythematosus and myositis. Resunab has demonstrated pre-clinical efficacy in a number of inflammatory and fibrotic disease animal models. In inflammatory models it was shown to reduce the migration
of inflammatory cells into the site of inflammation, stimulate the production of the resolving (&#147;anti-inflammatory&#148;) eicosanoids, and down-regulate and reduce pro-inflammatory mediators and cytokines. In fibrosis models it was shown to
reduce tissue collagen production, tissue fibrosis, stimulate the production of the resolving (&#147;anti-inflammatory&#148;) eicosanoids and reduce the pro-fibrotic cytokine TGF-beta. The net result is that Resunab&#151;through activation of
CB2&#151;triggers a natural inflammatory resolution pathway and is therefore expected to offer a new and promising mechanism for the potential treatment of chronic inflammation and fibrosis. </P>

include autoimmune diseases, allergies, reactions to infections and tissue breakdown, hereditary diseases as well as diseases of unknown etiology. Names of inflammatory diseases typically have the suffix&#148; &#147;its&#148; (e.g. bronchitis,

10% suffers from asthma, for example), our initial focus is on a large subset of serious chronic inflammatory diseases that are rare and have no effective treatment. These diseases are categorized as &#147;orphan diseases&#148;, meaning they affect
no more than 200,000 patients, each, in the U.S. Examples include cystic fibrosis, systemic scleroderma, polymyositis, dermatomyositis, primary biliary cirrhosis, pemphigus and idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis. </P>

disorder characterized by the accumulation of thick, viscous secretions in the lungs. This, in turn, leads to a chronic underlying inflammation that leads to persistent bacterial infection that then causes excessive inflammation and fibrosis .
Consequently, the cystic fibrosis airway is exposed to a vicious cycle of obstruction, infection, and inflammation, all intimately linked. Airway inflammation begins early in the disease course, sometimes in infants as young as four weeks old. The
inflammatory process persists throughout the patient&#146;s life and, if left unchecked, irreversibly damages the airways, leading to bronchiectasis and progressive decline in lung function. Gradual deterioration in breathing capacity eventually
results in death with current life expectancy of approximately 40 years. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Figure 3: Factors involved in cystic fibrosis progression </P>

 </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Cystic fibrosis is caused by a mutation in the gene Cystic Fibrosis Transmembrane Conductance Regulator, or
CFTR. The defective CFTR gene results in a chloride ion transport, leading to chronic pulmonary inflammation associated with excess mucus secretion very early in the lives of these affected patients. This chronic pulmonary inflammation damages the
lung tissue and provides a fertile environment for bacteria to grow, leading to chronic bacterial infections in the lungs. This chronic infection then further exacerbates inflammation and leads to fibrosis (scarring) of the lung tissue that results
in a gradual decrease in lung capacity finally resulting in death from pulmonary incapacity. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">In January 2012, Vertex (Nasdaq:VRTX)
launched Kalydeco&#153;, or Kalydeco, the first ever CF drug specifically targeting the underlying genetic defect in the CFTR ion channel. Kalydeco is a small synthetic oral molecule that helps correct the function of the G551D mutant CFTR protein
resulting in improved breathing by approximately 10% in CF patients. However, with at least 1,300 different known mutations in the CFTR gene, Kalydeco can only be used by a specific sub-section of the CF population who suffer from a limited number

<P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Scleroderma is a chronic connective tissue disease characterized by the thickening of the skin and is generally classified as an autoimmune
rheumatic disease. According to the Scleroderma Foundation, about 300,000 Americans have scleroderma with one third having the systemic form. The disease affects mainly adults (80% of patients are women) with onset typically in the patient&#146;s
30&#146;s or 40&#146;s. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Systemic scleroderma may affect the tissues in many parts of the body. The tissues of affected organs become hard
and fibrous, adversely affecting their function. There are two major recognized sub-categories of systemic scleroderma &#147;diffuse&#148; and &#147;limited&#148; with each representing about 50% of the systemic scleroderma patient population. In
limited scleroderma, skin thickening is less widespread, typically confined to the fingers, hands and face, and develops slowly over years. Although internal problems occur, they are less frequent and tend to be less severe than in diffuse
scleroderma, and are usually delayed in onset for several years. In diffuse scleroderma, which affects approximately 50,000 Americans, skin thickening occurs more rapidly and involves more skin areas than in limited disease and eventually can
involve the skin, esophagus, gastrointestinal tract (stomach and bowels), lungs, kidneys, heart and other internal organs. Diffuse scleroderma patients have a high mortality rate with approximately 50% survival over a 10-year period. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">There are currently no cures or effective therapies for diffuse scleroderma. While not fully understood, it is believed that inflammation
leading to fibrosis is the driving force behind the disease&#146;s progress, symptoms and eventual mortality. In particular, the pro-fibrotic cytokine TGF beta has been identified as a key player in the progression of the disease and, we believe, is
an important target for diffuse scleroderma therapy. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:18pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B>Current Treatment Alternatives for Inflammatory Diseases </B></P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B><I>Overview </I></B></P> <P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Drugs used to treat
inflammatory diseases are broadly divided into two classes: steroids and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs. Non-steroidal drugs, in turn, can be categorized into synthetic drugs, which include Resunab, and biological drugs, which include
monoclonal antibody and protein therapies. Synthetic drugs are typically administered orally while biologic drugs generally need to be administered by injection. According to Global Business Intelligence Research, the global market for drugs to
treat inflammation in 2010 was approximately $58 billion and is expected to grow to approximately $86 billion by 2017. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Corticosteroids
are the most commonly prescribed medications for treating inflammatory diseases because of their high potency, unparalleled formulation flexibility, and low cost. However, chronic corticosteroid use is limited by adverse side effects that include
hypertension, high glucose levels/diabetes, obesity, brittle bones/osteoporosis, immunosuppression/increased infection, glaucoma and psychosis. Thus, safer yet potent alternatives to steroids have long been sought to fill this unmet medical need. We
believe the global market for corticosteroids was approximately $88 billion in 2013. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Non-steroid anti-inflammatory synthetic drugs, or
NSAIDs, include the older generation of non-specific COX inhibitors, such as ibuprofen, naproxen, and Aspirin&#153; (possibly the most commonly used drug in the world), and a newer generation of specific inhibitors of COX-2, such as Celebrex<SUP
STYLE="font-size:85%; vertical-align:top">&reg;</SUP>, or Celebrex, and Vioxx. COX inhibitors are drugs that inhibit the action of the COX enzymes, which are responsible for producing factors that promote inflammation (known as pro-inflammatory
eicosanoids). The older generation of COX inhibitors inhibits both COX-1 and COX-2 and is associated with severe gastrointestinal adverse effects. The newer generation of NSAID drugs which are specific for COX-2, originally designed to be safer in
terms of gastrointestinal side effects, have subsequently been found to have cardiovascular side effects. These side effects have led to the withdrawal of the drug Vioxx from the market and specific black-box warnings for the related drug Celebrex.
The market for oral NSAIDs was approximately $5.4 billion in 2013. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Non-steroid biological drugs are used to treat severe cases of
inflammation in autoimmune diseases. These drugs are large molecule proteins produced from live cells and not by way of artificial chemical synthesis. </P>

Examples of this type of drug are Enbrel<SUP STYLE="font-size:85%; vertical-align:top">&reg;</SUP> and Remicade<SUP STYLE="font-size:85%; vertical-align:top">&reg;</SUP>, both of which are used
for treating severe rheumatoid arthritis and psoriasis as well as inflammatory bowel disease. These drugs have a number of disadvantages including that the drugs must be administered by injection/IV, their costs are high and they are associated with
increased incidence of malignancy and infection. This is the largest market of anti-inflammatory drugs with anti-TNF therapies for rheumatoid arthritis alone projected to reach $23 billion by 2015, according to Global Industry Analysts. </P>

inflammation (both underlying and infection-driven) in CF treatment is universally accepted, but we believe current anti-inflammatory treatments present a paradox: while treatment with systemic steroid and ibuprofen (a COX 1 &amp; 2 inhibitor) are
clearly effective in improving the symptoms of CF, the side effects associated with chronic treatment using these drugs are significant and as a result these drugs have limited long-term utility. Specifically, long term usage of oral corticosteroids
in children gives rise to such side effects as glucose intolerance, cataract formation, multiple bone fractures secondary to osteoporosis or osteopenia, Cushing Syndrome effects, and anorexia nervosa as well as growth retardation. The side effects
of high doses of ibuprofen taken for an extended duration are mainly gastrointestinal side effects. Other therapies routinely used by CF patients include antibiotics, such as Cayston from Gilead, and TOBI from Novartis, and mucolytics, such as
Pulmozyme from Genentech. In addition, Vertex currently markets the only approved drug, Kalydeco, specifically targeting the defective protein product of the CFTR gene mutation in CF. However, it can only be effective for 4.5% of the CF patient
population that have a specific CFTR gene mutation. According to Global Industry Analysts report published in June 2010, the market for CF medicines is projected to be $896 million by 2015, not including Kalydeco. </P>

medications for scleroderma focus on treating the four main features of the disease: inflammation, autoimmunity, vascular disease, and tissue fibrosis. For inflammation, the most commonly prescribed medicines for scleroderma are NSAIDs and
corticosteroids. As described above, these medicines have significant adverse effects when given chronically, but more important they have not proven to be effective in treating scleroderma. For autoimmunity, the most commonly prescribed medicines
for scleroderma are immunosuppressants. These include methotrexate, cyclosporine, anti-thymocyte globulin, mycophenolate mofetil, azathioprine, and cyclophosphamide. While these have been shown to have some benefit, they are effective only in a
limited number of cases and have serious side effects including increased infection and malignancy. For vascular disease, the most commonly prescribed medicines for scleroderma are medicines which improve blood flow to target organs affected by the
disease and reduce blood pressure. These include calcium channel blockers, angiotensin converting enzyme, or ACE inhibitors, endothelin-1 receptor inhibitors and prostacyclins. While these drugs are effective for the treatment of some of the
vascular complications of scleroderma they have no benefit for the inflammatory or fibrotic manifestations. The last class of drugs for the treatment of scleroderma is the anti-fibrotics. The most commonly prescribed anti-fibrotic medicines for
scleroderma are colchicine, para-aminobenzoic acid, or PABA, dimethyl sulfoxide, and D-penicillamine. These drugs are typically of limited benefit and are used fairly infrequently. Recently the drug pirfenidone was approved in Europe and the United
States for the treatment of Idiopathic Pulmonary Fibrosis (a disease that also causes fibrosis of the lungs). However, its effectiveness in treating scleroderma has not been established. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:18pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B>Resunab&#146;s Mechanism of Action is Distinct from NSAIDs and Steroids </B></P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Corticosteroids and NSAIDs exert their effect by inhibiting inflammation. In simple terms, both classes of drugs inhibit inflammation by
&#147;interfering&#148; with the biochemical pathways in the cell that promote and sustain inflammation. For example, NSAID directly inhibit the activity of the COX 1 and COX 2 enzymes that are responsible for generating pro-inflammatory
eicosanoids. A drawback of this approach is that it only inhibits one arm of the eicosanoid pathway (e.g. COX but not LOX) resulting in an increase in LOX-derived inflammatory mediators which leads to gastrointestinal and cardiovascular side effects
(termed &#147;molecular shunting&#148;). </P>

 <P STYLE="margin-top:0pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Resunab, on the other hand, activates the natural pathways that resolve inflammation, the so
called resolving pathway or &#147;off-switch.&#148; By doing so, we believe that Resunab is less likely to cause the side effects that result from the accumulation of certain pro-inflammatory eicosanoids. We also believe Resunab&#146;s unique
mechanism of action is expected to provide a safer and potentially more effective treatment for chronic inflammation than the current alternatives- steroids and NSAIDs. Resunab may have the potential to safely treat a wide spectrum of chronic
inflammatory diseases in which the resolution of inflammation, or the &#147;off&#148; switch, fails to occur. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:18pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B>Safety&nbsp;&amp; Toxicology </B></P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">To date, Resunab has undergone an extensive battery of animal safety and toxicology studies in support of Phase II clinical development. Unlike
other CB2 agonists, Resunab exhibits limited blood brain barrier penetration and negligible CB1 activity <I>in vivo</I> resulting in limited central nervous system side effects. Results of the safety pharmacology studies in animals assessing the
central nervous system, cardiovascular and respiratory systems, renal system and gastrointestinal system were all negative and support that there should be a significant safety margin at anticipated therapeutics doses of Resunab in patients. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Animal toxicological profiles of orally administered Resunab in single and multi-dose studies in mice, rats, and dogs, and a battery of <I>in
vitro </I>and <I>in vivo</I> genetic toxicity studies, have been conducted, including a chronic rat toxicology that was requested by the FDA and successfully completed. The results of these studies showed no major toxicological concerns and an
excellent safety margin based on drug exposure levels in animals compared to human exposure. In support of Phase II clinical trials, thirteen-week GLP toxicology studies have been completed in rats and dogs. Based on the results of these studies and
prior clinical trials, the safety margin in humans is estimated to be between 8 and 32 times greater than the doses planned for our next clinical trials. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:18pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B>Pre-clinical Results </B></P> <P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">In pre-clinical
studies, Resunab has demonstrated clear efficacy at resolving inflammation in a number of animal pharmacology models in which inflammation was induced by a variety of means: arachidonic acid, Zymosin, PAF, IL-1-beta, TNF-alpha and Freund&#146;s
complete adjuvant. Similarly, fibrosis was induced in skin tissue by bleomycin and TGF beta receptor activation and in lung tissue by bleomycin. Of particular note, Resunab suppressed tissue destruction in several of these disease models. At the
cellular level, in various models Resunab acted to reduce the migration of inflammatory cells into the site of inflammation, stimulate the production of the resolving mediators LXA4 and PGJ2, and down regulate and reduce the pro-inflammatory
cytokines (IL-1&szlig; and IL-6) and the pro-fibrotic cytokine TOF-beta. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:18pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B><I>Effect of Resunab in Fibrotic Disease Animal Models </I></B></P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The efficacy of Resunab was investigated in three mouse models of scleroderma. Oral administration of Resunab once-a-day at 1 mg/kg/day
inhibited dermal fibrosis in the three models as measured by reductions in dermal thickness, markers of collagen production, and myofibroblast abundance (cells that produce collagen). Histopathologic evaluation revealed that Resunab inhibited the
fibrosis of the skin tissue in each of these models. In addition, oral administration of Resunab was effective at inhibiting lung fibrosis in a bleomycin-induced mouse scleroderma model. Collectively, we believe this data supports the development of
Resunab as a potent and novel anti-fibrotic/anti-inflammatory drug with the potential to treat some of the key manifestations of human scleroderma. </P>

anti-fibrotic effects of Resunab on dermal fibroblasts isolated from diffuse cutaneous scleroderma patients. Dermal fibroblasts from scleroderma patients overproduce extracellular matrix proteins like collagen and the pro-fibrotic cytokine TGF-beta.
Further supporting its anti-fibrotic activity, Resunab inhibited new collagen synthesis, reduced TGF-beta and increased anti-inflammatory (resolving) eicosanoid levels in this ex-vivo model of human scleroderma. These responses were statistically
significant with a p&lt;0.001 as determined using the Student-Newmen Keuls post-hoc test for multiple comparisons. TGF-beta has been identified in published scientific literature to be an important cytokine in promoting inflammation and fibrosis in
multiple diseases and conditions including scleroderma and cystic fibrosis. While no pre-clinical model is 100% predictive of clinical efficacy, the results from our pre-clinical data provide a rationale for further clinical development. </P>

serious or life threatening disease or condition, including a fast track product, if it is found to have an effect on a surrogate endpoint that is reasonably likely to predict a clinical benefit. FDA may also approve a product under accelerated
approval authority if it is found to have an effect on a clinical endpoint that can be measured earlier than an effect on irreversible morbidity or mortality (also referred to as an intermediate endpoint). The evidence to support accelerated
approval may be epidemiological, pathophysiological, therapeutic, and pharmacologic or based on the use of biomarkers. Accelerated Approval can be withdrawn or the labeled indication of the drug changed if trials fail to verify clinical benefit or

is a U.S. multi-center trial. The lead Principal Investigator will be Dr.&nbsp;Robert Spiera of the Hospital of Special Surgery, New York City, New York. Patients will be screened and those meeting trial criteria will be randomized to one of four
arms. Patients will be monitored for safety and tolerability throughout the study. The primary goal of this trial is to establish safety of Resunab in diffuse scleroderma patients and efficacy based on a change in the Combined Response Index in
diffuse cutaneous Systemic Sclerosis. Secondary endpoint measurements will include patient assessment scores, drug action biomarkers, disease biomarkers and metabolipidomic profiles. </P>

20 mg once a day and 20 mg twice a day, versus placebo. We expect to initiate the clinical study during the second quarter of 2015. Patients in the study will be 18-30 years of age with mild to moderate cystic fibrosis as assessed by lung function
tests. The trial design will have a two-week screening period, followed by a 12-week active treatment period, and then a four-week safety follow-up. The study planned is a multi-center U.S. and European trial. The lead Principal Investigators in the
U.S. will be Dr.&nbsp;James Chmiel of the Rainbow Babies&nbsp;&amp; Children&#146;s Hospital, Cleveland, Ohio and in the E.U., Dr.&nbsp;Stuart Elborn of Queens University Hospital, Belfast, Ireland. Patients will be screened and those meeting the
trial criteria will be randomized into one of four arms. Patients will be monitored for safety and tolerability throughout the study. The primary goal of this trial is to establish safety of Resunab in CF patients and an efficacy assessment based on
pulmonary function and the reduction of inflammatory markers. Secondary efficacy assessments will include the CF biomarker score, patient scores and drug action biomarkers. </P>

patients with a number of drugs including immunosupressants and cytotoxics to try to reduce the autoimmune response of the disease. However, these drugs have not proven to be very effective in treating scleroderma and there remains a high unmet need
for new effective drugs to treat the progressive fibrosis in scleroderma. Because of this several companies, including Bristol Myers Squibb Company (NYSE: BMY), Promedior, Sanofi (NYSE: SNY), Digna Biotech, FibroGen, Inc. (Nasdaq: FGEN) and Biogen
Idec, Inc. (Nasdaq: BIIB), are actively working to developing new drugs for scleroderma which target inflammation and/or fibrosis. To the best of our knowledge, Resunab offers a unique mode of action to treat scleroderma being one of the few oral

regulatory authority. The data is often generated in two distinct development states: pre-clinical and clinical. Resunab or other products that we may develop or acquire in the future must be
approved by the FDA through the IND process before they may be legally marketed in the United States. For new chemical entities, the pre-clinical development stage generally involves synthesizing the active component, developing the formulation and
determining the manufacturing process, as well as carrying out non-human toxicology, pharmacology and drug metabolism studies which support subsequent clinical testing. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The clinical stage of development can generally be divided into three sequential phases that may overlap, Phase I, Phase II and Phase III
clinical trials. In Phase I, generally, small numbers of healthy volunteers are initially exposed to single escalating doses and then multiple escalating doses of the product candidate. The primary purpose of these studies is to assess the
metabolism, pharmacologic action, side effect tolerability and safety of the drug. Phase II trials typically involve studies in disease-affected patients to determine the dose required to produce the desired benefits, while Phase IIb trials are
designed to determine efficacy. At the same time, safety and further pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic information is collected. In some instances, formal Phase I and Phase II trials may not be deemed necessary or required by the FDA. Such is
often the case when the safety and efficacy of an active ingredient is considered to be well understood by the FDA. Under established regulatory frameworks, pharmaceutical products with active ingredients equal or similar to those known by the FDA
often enter more streamlined development programs than compounds entirely new to the agency. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Post-approval studies, sometimes referred to
as Phase IV clinical trials, may be conducted after initial marketing approval. Sometimes, these studies are used to gain additional experience from the treatment of patients in the intended therapeutic condition, then often referred to as Phase IV
clinical trials. In certain instances, the FDA may mandate the performance of Phase IV studies. In other situations, post-approval studies aim to gain additional indications for a medication, then often indicated as Phase IIIb studies. </P>

<P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">In the United States, the process of obtaining regulatory approvals and the subsequent compliance with appropriate federal, state, local and
foreign statutes and regulations require the expenditure of substantial time and financial resources. Failure to comply with the applicable United States requirements at any time during the product development process, approval process or after
approval, may subject an applicant to administrative or judicial sanctions. These sanctions could include the FDA&#146;s refusal to approve pending applications, withdrawal of an approval, a clinical hold, warning letters, product recalls or
withdrawals from the market, product seizures, total or partial suspension of production or distribution, injunctions, fines, refusals of government contracts, restitution, disgorgement, or civil or criminal penalties. Any agency or judicial
enforcement action could have a material adverse effect on us. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Prior to the start of human clinical studies for a new drug in the United
States, pre-clinical laboratory and animal tests are often performed under the FDA&#146;s Good Laboratory Practices regulations. The sponsor must submit the result of the pre-clinical tests, together with manufacturing information, analytical data
and any available clinical data or literature and a proposed clinical protocol to the FDA as part of an IND application, which is a request for authorization from the FDA to administer an investigational drug or biological product to humans. Similar
filings are required in other countries. The amount of data that must be supplied in the IND depends on the phase of the study. Phase I studies typically require less data than larger Phase II and III studies. A clinical plan must be submitted to
the FDA prior to commencement of a clinical trial. If the FDA has concerns about the clinical plan or the safety of the proposed studies, they may suspend or terminate the study at any time. Studies must be conducted in accordance with good clinical
practice and regulator reporting of study progress and any adverse experiences is required. Studies are also subject to review by independent institutional review boards responsible for overseeing studies at particular sites and protecting human
research study subjects. An independent institutional review board may also suspend or terminate a study once initiated. Accordingly, we cannot be sure that submission of an IND will result in the FDA allowing clinical trials to begin, or that once
begun, issues will not arise that could cause the trial to be suspended or terminated. </P>

<P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Following pivotal or Phase III trial completion, data is analyzed to determine safety and efficacy. Data is then filed with the FDA in a New
Drug Application, or an NDA, along with proposed labeling for the product and information about the manufacturing and testing processes and facilities that will be used to ensure product quality. In the United States, FDA approval of an NDA must be
obtained before marketing a pharmaceutical product. The NDA must contain proof of safety, purity, potency and efficacy, which entails extensive pre-clinical and clinical testing. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The FDA will likely re-analyze the clinical trial data, which could result in extensive discussions between the FDA and us during the review
process. The review and evaluation of applications by the FDA is extensive and time consuming and may take several years to complete. The FDA may conduct a pre-approval inspection of the manufacturing facilities for the new product to determine
whether they comply with current good manufacturing practice requirements and may also audit data from clinical and pre-clinical trials. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">There is no assurance that the FDA will act favorably or quickly in making such reviews and significant difficulties or costs may be
encountered in our efforts to obtain FDA approvals. The FDA may require that certain contraindications, warnings or precautions be including in the product labeling, or may condition the approval of the NDA on other changes to the proposed labeling,
development of adequate controls and specifications, or a commitment to conduct post-marketing testing or clinical trials and surveillance programs to monitor the safety of approved products that have been commercialized. Further, the FDA may place
conditions on approvals including the requirement for a risk evaluation and mitigation strategy, or REMS, to assure the safe use of the drug. If the FDA concludes a REMS is needed, the sponsor of the NDA must submit a proposed REMS; the FDA will not
approve the NDA without an approved REMS, if required. A REMS could include medication guides, physician communication plans, or elements to assure safe use, such as restricted distribution methods, patient registries and other risk minimization
tools. Any of these limitations on approval or marketing could restrict the commercial promotion, distribution, prescription or dispensing of products. Product approvals maybe withdrawn for non-compliance with regulatory standards or if problems
occur, following the initial marketing of the product. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:18pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B><I>Orphan Drug Designation </I></B></P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Under the Orphan Drug Act, the FDA may grant orphan drug designation to a drug intended to treat a rare disease or condition, which is
generally a disease or condition that affects fewer than 200,000 individuals in the United States and for which there is no reasonable expectation that the cost of developing and making a drug available in the Unites States for this type of disease
or condition will be recovered from sales of the product. Orphan product designation must be requested before submitting an NDA. After the FDA grants orphan drug designation, the identity of the therapeutic agent and its potential orphan use are
disclosed publicly by the FDA. Orphan product designation does not convey any advantage in or shorten the duration of regulatory review and approval process. In addition to the potential period of exclusivity, orphan designation makes a company
eligible for grant funding of up to $400,000 per year for four years to defray costs of clinical trial expenses, tax credits for clinical research expenses and potential exemption from the FDA application user fee. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">If a product that has orphan designation subsequently receives the first FDA approval for the disease or condition for which it has such
designation, the product is entitled to orphan drug exclusivity, which means the FDA may not approve any other applications to market the same drug for the same indication for seven years, except in limited circumstances, such as (i)&nbsp;the
drug&#146;s orphan designation is revoked; (ii)&nbsp;its marketing approval is withdrawn; (iii)&nbsp;the orphan exclusivity holder consents to the approval of another applicant&#146;s product; (iv)&nbsp;the orphan exclusivity holder is unable to
assure the availability of a sufficient quantity of drug; or (v)&nbsp;a showing of clinical superiority to the product with orphan exclusivity by a competitor product. If a drug designated as an orphan product receives marketing approval for an
indication broader than what is designated, it may not be entitled to orphan drug exclusivity. There can be no assurance that we will receive orphan drug designation for Resunab in the indications of cystic fibrosis, scleroderma, or other orphan
inflammatory diseases. </P>

variations in the member state regimes. All member states, however, currently require independent institutional review board approval of interventional clinical trials. Except for the United Kingdom Phase I studies in health volunteers, all clinical

centralized procedure and the decentralized procedure. We intend to determine which process we will follow, if any, in the future. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><U>Mutual Recognition Procedure</U>: An applicant submits an application in one European Union member state, known as the reference member
state. Once the reference member state has granted the marketing authorization, the applicant may choose to submit applications in other concerned member states, requesting them to mutually recognize the marketing authorizations already granted.
Under this mutual recognition process, authorities in other concerned member states have 55 days to raise objections, which must then be resolved by discussion among the concerned member states, the reference member state and the applicant within 90
days of the commencement of the mutual recognition procedure. If any disagreement remains, all considerations by authorities in the concerned member states are suspended and the disagreement is resolved through an arbitration process. The mutual
recognition procedure results in separate national marketing authorizations in the reference member state. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><U>Centralized Procedure</U>:
This procedure is currently mandatory for products developed by means of a biotechnological process and optional for new active substances and other &#147;innovative medicinal products with novel characteristics.&#148; Under this procedure, an
application is submitted to the European Agency for the Evaluation of Medical Products. Two European Union member states are appointed to conduct an initial evaluation of each application. These countries each prepare an assessment report that is
then used as the basis of a scientific opinion of the Committee on Proprietary Medical Products. If this opinion is favorable, it is sent to the European Commission, which drafts a decision. After consulting with the member states, the European
Commission adopts a decision and grants a marketing authorization, which is valid throughout the European Union and confers the same rights and obligations in each of the member states as a marketing authorization granted by that member state. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><U>Decentralized Procedure</U>: The most recently introduced of the three processes for obtaining approval of new medicinal processes in the
European Union, the decentralized procedure is similar to the mutual recognition procedure described above, but with differences in the timing that key documents are provided to concerned member states by the reference member state, the overall

or in patient populations not described in the drug&#146;s approved labeling (known as &#147;off-label use&#148;), limitations on industry-sponsored scientific and educational activities, and requirements for promotional activities involving the
internet. Although physicians may prescribe legally available drugs for off-label uses, manufacturers may not market or promote such off-label uses. Modifications or enhancements to the products or labeling or changes of site of manufacture are
often subject to the approval of the FDA and other regulators, which may or may not be received or may result in a lengthy review process. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Prescription drug advertising is subject to federal, state and foreign regulations. In the United States, the FDA regulates prescription drug
promotion, including direct-to-consumer advertising. Prescription drug promotion materials must be submitted to the FDA in conjunction with their first use. Any distribution of prescription drug products and pharmaceutical samples must comply with
the U.S. Prescription Drug Marketing Act, a part of the U.S. Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act. Once a product is approved, its manufacture is subject to comprehensive and continuing regulations by the FDA. The FDA regulations require the products
be manufactured in specific approved facilities and in accordance with current good manufacturing practices, and NDA holders must list their products and register their manufacturing establishments with the FDA. These regulations also impose certain
organizational, procedural and documentation requirements with respect to manufacturing and quality assurance activities. Drug manufacturers and other entities involved in the manufacture and distribution of approved drugs are subject to periodic
unannounced inspections by the FDA and certain state agencies for compliance with current good manufacturing practice and other laws. NDA holders using contract manufacturers, laboratories or packagers are responsible for the selection and
monitoring of qualified firms. These firms are subject to inspections by the FDA at any time, and the discovery of violative conditions could result in enforcement actions that interrupt the operation of any such facilities or the ability to
distribute products manufactured, processed or tested by them. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:18pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B><I>Special Protocol Assessment </I></B></P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act directs the FDA to meet with sponsors, pursuant to a sponsor&#146;s written request, for the purpose of
reaching agreement on the design and size of clinical trials intended to form the primary basis of an efficacy claim in an NDA. If an agreement is reached, the FDA will reduce the agreement to writing and make it part of the administrative record.
This agreement is called a special protocol assessment, or SPA. While the FDA&#146;s guidance on SPAs states that documented SPAs should be considered binding on the review division, the FDA has latitude to change its assessment if certain
exceptions apply. Exceptions include public health concerns emerging that were unrecognized at the time of the protocol assessment, identification of a substantial scientific issue essential to the safety or efficacy testing that later comes to
light, a sponsor&#146;s failure to follow the protocol agreed upon, or the FDA&#146;s reliance on data, assumptions or information that are determined to be wrong. </P>

Product Safety Commission, the Federal Trade Commission, the Occupational Safety&nbsp;&amp; Health Administration, the Environmental Protection Agency, and state and local governments. Sales, marketing and scientific/educational programs must also
comply with federal and state fraud and abuse laws. Pricing and rebate programs must comply with the Medicaid rebate requirements of the U.S. Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1990. If products are made available to authorized users of the

handling of any controlled substances must comply with the U.S. Controlled Substances Act and Controlled Substances Import and Export Act. Products must meet applicable child-resistant packaging
requirements under the U.S. Poison Prevention Packaging Act. Manufacturing, sales, promotion and other activities are also potentially subject to federal and state consumer protection and unfair completion laws. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The distribution of pharmaceutical products is subject to additional requirements and regulations, including extensive record-keeping,

Reimbursement </I></B></P> <P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Significant uncertainty exists as to the coverage and reimbursement status of any of our drug candidates that
ultimately may obtain regulatory approval. In both the United States and foreign markets, our ability to commercialize our product candidates successfully, and to attract commercialization partners for our product candidates, depends in significant
part on the availability of adequate financial coverage and reimbursement from third-party payers, including, in the United States, governmental payers such as the Medicare and Medicaid programs, managed care organizations, and private health
insurers. Medicare is a federally funded program managed by the CMS, through local fiscal intermediaries and carriers that administer coverage and reimbursement for certain healthcare items and services furnished to the elderly and disabled.
Medicaid is an insurance program for certain categories of patients whose income and assets fall below state defined levels and who are otherwise uninsured that is both federally and state funded and managed by each state. The federal government
sets general guidelines for Medicaid and each state creates specific regulations that govern its individual program. Each payer has its own process and standards for determining whether it will cover and reimburse a procedure or particular product.
Private payers often rely on the lead of the governmental payers in rendering coverage and reimbursement determinations. Therefore, achieving favorable CMS coverage and reimbursement is usually a significant gating issue for successful introduction
of a new product. The competitive position of some of our products will depend, in part, upon the extent of coverage and adequate reimbursement for such products and for the procedures in which such products are used. Prices at which we or our
customers seek reimbursement for our product candidates can be subject to challenge, reduction or denial by the government and other payers. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The United States Congress and state legislatures may, from time to time, propose and adopt initiatives aimed at cost containment, which could
impact our ability to sell our product candidates profitably. For example, in March 2010, President Obama signed into law the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act and the associated reconciliation bill, which we refer to collectively as the
Health Care Reform Law, a sweeping law intended to broaden access to health insurance, reduce or constrain the growth of healthcare spending, enhance remedies against fraud and abuse, add new transparency requirements for healthcare and health
insurance industries, impose new taxes and fees on the health industry and impose additional health policy reforms. Effective October&nbsp;1, 2010, the Health Care Reform Law revised the definition of &#147;average manufacturer price&#148; for
reporting purposes, which could increase the amount of Medicaid drug rebates to states once the provision is effective. Further, the law imposes a significant annual fee on companies that manufacture or import branded prescription drug products.
Substantial new provisions affecting compliance have also been enacted, which may require us to modify our business practices with healthcare practitioners. We will not know the full effects of the Health Care Reform Law until applicable federal and
state agencies issue regulations or guidance under the new law. Although it is too early to determine the effect of the Health Care Reform Law, the new law appears likely to continue the pressure on pharmaceutical pricing, especially under the
Medicare program, and may also increase our regulatory burdens and operating costs. Moreover, in the coming years, additional changes could be made to governmental healthcare programs that could significantly impact the success of our product
candidates. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The cost of pharmaceuticals continues to generate substantial governmental and third-party payer interest. We expect that the
pharmaceutical industry will experience pricing pressures due to the trend toward managed healthcare, the increasing influence of managed care organizations and additional legislative proposals. Our results of operations could be adversely affected
by current and future healthcare reforms. </P>

 <P STYLE="margin-top:0pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Some third-party payers also require pre-approval of coverage for new or innovative devices or
drug therapies before they will reimburse healthcare providers that use such therapies. While we cannot predict whether any proposed cost-containment measures will be adopted or otherwise implemented in the future, the announcement or adoption of
these proposals could have a material adverse effect on our ability to obtain adequate prices for our product candidates and operate profitably. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">In addition, in some foreign countries, the proposed pricing for a drug must be approved before it may be lawfully marketed. The requirements
governing drug pricing vary widely from country to country. For example, the European Union provides options for its member states to restrict the range of medicinal products for which their national health insurance systems provide reimbursement
and to control the prices of medicinal products for human use. A member state may approve a specific price for the medicinal product or it may instead adopt a system of direct or indirect controls on the profitability of the company placing the
medicinal product on the market. There can be no assurance that any country that has price controls or reimbursement limitations for pharmaceutical products will allow favorable reimbursement and pricing arrangements for any of our products.
Historically, products launched in the European Union do not follow price structures of the United States and generally tend to be significantly lower. </P>

expenses will continue to increase as we advance to clinical trials for indications for the treatment of cystic fibrosis and scleroderma. We may elect to pursue FDA approval for Resunab in other indications, which will result in significant
additional research and development expenses. As a result, we expect to continue to incur substantial losses for the foreseeable future, and these losses will increase. We are uncertain when or if we will be able to achieve or sustain profitability.
If we achieve profitability in the future, we may not be able to sustain profitability in subsequent periods. Failure to become and remain profitable would impair our ability to sustain operations and adversely affect the price of our common stock

parties in ways that we currently do not intend or on terms that may not be favorable to us. If we choose to pursue additional indications and/or geographies for Resunab or otherwise expand more rapidly than we presently anticipate we may also need

fibrosis, and may not commence human clinical trials in scleroderma until the second quarter of 2015 at the earliest, and do not intend to submit to the FDA the clinical protocol for cystic fibrosis or commence clinical studies until the second
quarter of 2015. The FDA may reject our IND for Resunab at any time during the 30 day period following IND submission. If our IND is rejected, the time in which we expect to commence our Phase II clinical programs will be extended and such extension
will increase our expenses and increase our need for additional capital. Moreover, there is no guarantee that our Phase II clinical trials will be successful or that we will continue with clinical studies to support an approval from
the&nbsp;FDA&nbsp;for&nbsp;any indication. We note that most drug candidates never reach the clinical development stage and even those that do reach clinical development have only a small chance of successfully completing clinical development and
gaining regulatory approval. Therefore, our business currently depends entirely on the successful development, regulatory approval and commercialization of Resunab, which may never occur. </P>

required to conduct additional clinical trials to establish Resunab&#146;s safety and efficacy, before a New Drug Application, or NDA, can be filed with the FDA for marketing approval of Resunab. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Clinical testing is expensive, is difficult to design and implement, can take many years to complete and is uncertain as to outcome. Success
in early phases of pre-clinical and clinical trials does not ensure that later clinical trials will be successful, and interim results of a clinical trial do not necessarily predict final results. A failure of one or more of our clinical trials can
occur at any stage of testing. We may experience numerous unforeseen events during, or as a result of, the clinical trial process that could delay or prevent our ability to receive regulatory approval or commercialize Resunab. The research, testing,
manufacturing, labeling, packaging, storage, approval, sale, marketing, advertising and promotion, pricing, export, import and distribution of drug products are subject to extensive regulation by the FDA and other regulatory authorities in the
United States and other countries, which regulations differ from country to country. We are not permitted to market Resunab as a prescription pharmaceutical product in the United States until we receive approval of an NDA from the FDA, or in any
foreign countries until we receive the requisite approval from such countries. In the United States, the FDA generally requires the completion of clinical trials of each drug to establish its safety and efficacy and extensive pharmaceutical
development to ensure its quality before an NDA is approved. Regulatory authorities in other jurisdictions impose similar requirements. Of the large number of drugs in development, only a small percentage result in the submission of an NDA to the
FDA and even fewer are eventually approved for commercialization. We have never submitted an NDA to the FDA or comparable applications to other regulatory authorities. If our development efforts for Resunab, including regulatory approval, are not
successful for its planned indications, or if adequate demand for Resunab is not generated, our business will be harmed. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Our success

Securing FDA approval requires the submission of pre-clinical, clinical, and/or pharmacokinetic data, information about product manufacturing processes and inspection of facilities and supporting information to the FDA for each therapeutic
indication to establish a product candidate&#146;s safety and efficacy for each indication. Resunab may prove to have undesirable or unintended side effects, toxicities or other characteristics that may preclude our obtaining regulatory approval or

expensive, often takes many years, if approval is obtained at all, and can vary substantially based upon, among other things, the type, complexity and novelty of the product candidates involved, the jurisdiction in which regulatory approval is
sought and the substantial discretion of the regulatory authorities. Changes in the regulatory approval policy during the development period, changes in or the enactment of additional statutes or regulations, or changes in regulatory review for a
submitted product application may cause delays in the approval or rejection of an application. Regulatory approval obtained in one jurisdiction does not necessarily mean that a product candidate will receive regulatory approval in all jurisdictions
in which we may seek approval, but the failure to obtain approval in one jurisdiction may negatively impact our ability to seek approval in a different jurisdiction. Failure to obtain regulatory marketing approval for Resunab in any indication will

commercialize Resunab successfully. For example, if the approval process takes too long, we may miss market opportunities and give other companies the ability to develop competing products or establish market dominance. Any regulatory approval we
ultimately obtain may be limited or subject to restrictions or post-approval commitments that render Resunab not commercially viable. For example, regulatory authorities may approve Resunab for fewer or more limited indications than we request, may
not approve the price we intend to charge for Resunab, may grant approval contingent on the performance of costly post-marketing clinical trials, or may approve Resunab with a label that does not include the labeling claims necessary or desirable
for the successful commercialization of that indication. Further, the FDA or comparable foreign regulatory authorities may place conditions on approvals, such as risk management plans and a Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy, or REMS, to assure
the safe use of the drug. If the FDA concludes a REMS is needed, the sponsor of the NDA must submit a proposed REMS; the FDA will not approve the NDA without an approved REMS, if required. A REMS could include medication guides, physician
communication plans, or elements to assure safe use, such as restricted distribution methods, patient registries and other risk minimization tools. The FDA may also require a REMS for an approved product when new safety information emerges. Any of
these limitations on approval or marketing could restrict the commercial promotion, distribution, prescription or dispensing of Resunab. Moreover, product approvals may be withdrawn for non-compliance with regulatory standards or if problems occur
following the initial marketing of the product. Any of the foregoing scenarios could materially harm the commercial success of Resunab. </P>

Resunab for an indication, the FDA may still impose significant restrictions on its indicated uses or marketing or the conditions of approval, or impose ongoing requirements for potentially costly and time-consuming post-approval studies, including
Phase IV clinical trials, and post-market surveillance to monitor safety and efficacy. Resunab will also be subject to ongoing regulatory requirements governing the manufacturing, labeling, packaging, storage, distribution, safety surveillance,
advertising, promotion, recordkeeping and reporting of adverse events and other post-market information. These requirements include registration with the FDA, as well as continued compliance with current Good Clinical Practices regulations, or
cGCPs, for any clinical trials that we conduct post-approval. In addition, manufacturers of drug products and their facilities are subject to continual review and periodic inspections by the FDA and other regulatory authorities for compliance with
current Good Manufacturing Practices, or cGMP, requirements relating to quality control, quality assurance and corresponding maintenance of records and documents. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The FDA has the authority to require a risk evaluation and mitigation strategy, or REMS, as part of an NDA or after approval, which may impose
further requirements or restrictions on the distribution or use of an approved drug, such as limiting prescribing to certain physicians or medical centers that have undergone specialized training, limiting treatment to patients who meet certain
safe-use criteria or requiring patient testing, monitoring and/or enrollment in a registry. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">With respect to sales and marketing
activities by us or any future partner, advertising and promotional materials must comply with FDA rules in addition to other applicable federal, state and local laws in the United States and similar legal requirements in other countries. In the
United States, the distribution of product samples to physicians must comply with the requirements of the U.S. Prescription Drug Marketing Act. Application holders must obtain FDA approval for product and manufacturing changes, depending on the
nature of the change. We may also be subject, directly or indirectly through our customers and partners, to various fraud and abuse laws, including, without limitation, the U.S. Anti-Kickback Statute, U.S. False Claims Act, and similar state laws,
which impact, among other things, our proposed sales, marketing, and scientific/educational grant programs. If we participate in the U.S. Medicaid Drug Rebate Program, the Federal Supply Schedule of the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs, or other
government drug programs, we will be subject to complex laws and regulations regarding reporting and payment obligations. All of these activities are also potentially subject to U.S. federal and state consumer protection and unfair competition laws.
Similar requirements exist in many of these areas in other countries. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">In addition, if Resunab is approved for an indication, our product
labeling, advertising and promotion would be subject to regulatory requirements and continuing regulatory review. The FDA strictly regulates the promotional claims that may be made about prescription products. In particular, a product may not be
promoted for uses that are not approved by the FDA as reflected in the product&#146;s approved labeling. If we receive marketing approval for Resunab, physicians may nevertheless legally prescribe our products to their patients in a manner that is
inconsistent with the approved label. If we are found to have promoted such off-label uses, we may become subject to significant liability and government fines. The FDA and other agencies actively enforce the laws and regulations prohibiting the
promotion of off-label uses by a company, and any company that is found to have improperly promoted off-label uses may be subject to significant sanctions. The federal government has levied large civil and criminal fines against companies for
alleged improper promotion and has enjoined several companies from engaging in off-label promotion. The FDA has also requested that companies enter into consent decrees of permanent injunctions under which specified promotional conduct is changed or
curtailed. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">If we or a regulatory agency discover previously unknown problems with a product, such as adverse events of unanticipated

regulatory changes and proposed changes regarding the healthcare system that could prevent or delay marketing approval for Resunab, restrict or regulate post-approval activities and affect our ability to profitably sell Resunab. Legislative and
regulatory proposals have been made to expand post-approval requirements and restrict sales and promotional activities for pharmaceutical products. We do not know whether additional legislative changes will be enacted, or whether the FDA
regulations, guidance or interpretations will be changed, or what the impact of such changes on the marketing approvals of Resunab, if any, may be. In addition, increased scrutiny by the U.S. Congress of the FDA&#146;s approval process may
significantly delay or prevent marketing approval, as well as subject us to more stringent product labeling and post-marketing testing and other requirements. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">In the United States, the Medicare Modernization Act, or MMA, changed the way Medicare covers and pays for pharmaceutical products. The
legislation expanded Medicare coverage for drug purchases by the elderly and introduced a new reimbursement methodology based on average sales prices for drugs. In addition, this legislation authorized Medicare Part D prescription drug plans to use
formularies where they can limit the number of drugs that will be covered in any therapeutic class. As a result of this legislation and the expansion of federal coverage of drug products, we expect that there will be additional pressure to contain
and reduce costs. These cost reduction initiatives and other provisions of this legislation could decrease the coverage and price that we receive for Resunab and could seriously harm our business. While the MMA applies only to drug benefits for
Medicare beneficiaries, private payors often follow Medicare coverage policy and payment limitations in setting their own reimbursement rates, and any reduction in reimbursement that results from the MMA may result in a similar reduction in payments
from private payors. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">In March 2010, President Obama signed into law the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, as amended by the
Health Care and Education Affordability Reconciliation Act of 2010 or, collectively, the Health Care Reform Law, a sweeping law intended to broaden access to health insurance, reduce or constrain the growth of healthcare spending, enhance remedies
against fraud and abuse, add new transparency requirements for healthcare and health insurance industries, impose new taxes and fees on the health industry and impose additional health policy reforms. Effective October&nbsp;1, 2010, the Health Care
Reform Law revised the definition of &#147;average manufacturer price&#148; for reporting purposes, which could increase the amount of Medicaid drug rebates to states. Further, the new law imposed a significant annual fee on companies that
manufacture or import branded prescription drug products. Substantial new provisions affecting compliance have also been enacted, which may require us to modify our business practices with healthcare practitioners, and incur substantial costs to
ensure compliance. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Despite initiatives to invalidate the Health Care Reform Law, at this time it appears the implementation of the Health

until applicable federal and state agencies issue regulations or guidance under the new law. Although it is too early to determine the effect of the Health Care Reform Law, the new law appears
likely to continue the pressure on pharmaceutical pricing, especially under the Medicare program, and may also increase our regulatory burdens and operating costs. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">In addition, other legislative changes have been proposed and adopted in the United States since the Health Care Reform Law was enacted. On
August&nbsp;2, 2011, the Budget Control Act of 2011 among other things, created measures for spending reductions by Congress. A Joint Select Committee on Deficit Reduction, tasked with recommending a targeted deficit reduction of at least $1.2
trillion for the years 2013 through 2021, was unable to reach required goals, thereby triggering the legislation&#146;s automatic reduction to several government programs. This includes aggregate reductions to Medicare payments to providers of up to
2%&nbsp;per fiscal year, starting in 2013. On January&nbsp;2, 2013, President Obama signed into law the American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012, or the ATRA, which delayed for another two months the budget cuts mandated by these sequestration
provisions of the Budget Control Act of 2011. The ATRA, among other things, also reduced Medicare payments to several providers, including hospitals, imaging centers and cancer treatment centers, and increased the statute of limitations period for
the government to recover overpayments to providers from three to five years. We expect that additional federal healthcare reform measures will be adopted in the future, any of which could limit the amounts that federal and state governments will
pay for healthcare products and services, and in turn could significantly reduce the projected value of certain development projects and reduce our profitability. </P>

so-called &#147;off label&#148; use, it is unlawful for a pharmaceutical company to promote its products in a manner that is inconsistent with its approved label and any company which engages in
such conduct can subject that company to significant liability. Similarly, industry codes in the European Union and other foreign jurisdictions prohibit companies from engaging in off-label promotion and regulatory agencies in various countries
enforce violations of the code with civil penalties. While we intend to ensure that our promotional materials are consistent with our label, regulatory agencies may disagree with our assessment and may issue untitled letters, warning letters or may
institute other civil or criminal enforcement proceedings. In addition to FDA restrictions on marketing of pharmaceutical products, several other types of state and federal healthcare fraud and abuse laws have been applied in recent years to
restrict certain marketing practices in the pharmaceutical industry. These laws include the U.S. Anti-Kickback Statute, U.S. False Claims Act and similar state laws. Because of the breadth of these laws and the narrowness of the safe harbors, it is
possible that some of our business activities could be subject to challenge under one or more of these laws. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The U.S. Anti-Kickback
Statute prohibits, among other things, knowingly and willfully offering, paying, soliciting or receiving remuneration to induce, or in return for, purchasing, leasing, ordering or arranging for the purchase, lease or order of any healthcare item or
service reimbursable under Medicare, Medicaid or other federally financed healthcare programs. This statute has been interpreted broadly to apply to arrangements between pharmaceutical manufacturers on the one hand and prescribers, purchasers and
formulary managers on the other. Although there are several statutory exemptions and regulatory safe harbors protecting certain common activities from prosecution, the exemptions and safe harbors are drawn narrowly, and practices that involve
remuneration intended to induce prescribing, purchasing or recommending may be subject to scrutiny if they do not qualify for an exemption or safe harbor. Our practices may not, in all cases, meet all of the criteria for safe harbor protection from
anti-kickback liability. Moreover, recent health care reform legislation has strengthened these laws. For example, the Health Care Reform Law, among other things, amends the intent requirement of the U.S. Anti-Kickback Statute and criminal health
care fraud statutes; a person or entity no longer needs to have actual knowledge of this statute or specific intent to violate it. In addition, the Health Care Reform Law provides that the government may assert that a claim including items or
services resulting from a violation of the U.S. Anti-Kickback Statute constitutes a false or fraudulent claim for purposes of the U.S. False Claims Act. Federal false claims laws prohibit any person from knowingly presenting, or causing to be
presented, a false claim for payment to the federal government or knowingly making, or causing to be made, a false statement to get a false claim paid. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Over the past few years, pharmaceutical and other healthcare companies have been prosecuted under these laws for a variety of alleged
promotional and marketing activities, such as: allegedly providing free trips, free goods, sham consulting fees and grants and other monetary benefits to prescribers; reporting to pricing services inflated average wholesale prices that were then
used by federal programs to set reimbursement rates; engaging in off-label promotion that caused claims to be submitted to Medicare or Medicaid for non-covered, off-label uses; and submitting inflated best price information to the Medicaid Rebate
Program to reduce liability for Medicaid rebates. Most states also have statutes or regulations similar to the U.S. Anti-Kickback Statute and the U.S. False Claims Act, which apply to items and services reimbursed under Medicaid and other state
programs, or, in several states, apply regardless of the payor. Sanctions under these federal and state laws may include substantial civil monetary penalties, exclusion of a manufacturer&#146;s products from reimbursement under government programs,
substantial criminal fines and imprisonment. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:18pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B><I>We are, and will be, completely dependent on third parties to manufacture Resunab, and our

manufacturers for commercial supply and may not be able to engage a contract manufacturer for commercial supply of Resunab on favorable terms to us, or at all. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The facilities used by our contract manufacturers to manufacture Resunab must be approved by the FDA pursuant to inspections that will be
conducted after we submit our NDA to the FDA. We do not control the manufacturing process of, and are completely dependent on, our contract manufacturing partners for compliance with cGMPs for manufacture of both active drug substances and finished
drug products. These cGMP regulations cover all aspects of the manufacturing, testing, quality control and record keeping relating to Resunab. If our contract manufacturers cannot successfully manufacture material that conforms to our specifications
and the strict regulatory requirements of the FDA or others, they will not be able to secure and/or maintain regulatory approval for their manufacturing facilities. If the FDA or a comparable foreign regulatory authority does not approve these
facilities for the manufacture of Resunab or if it withdraws any such approval in the future, we may need to find alternative manufacturing facilities, which would significantly impact our ability to develop, obtain regulatory approval for or market
Resunab, if approved. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Our contract manufacturers will be subject to ongoing periodic unannounced inspections by the FDA and corresponding
state and foreign agencies for compliance with cGMPs and similar regulatory requirements. We will not have control over our contract manufacturers&#146; compliance with these regulations and standards. Failure by any of our contract manufacturers to
comply with applicable regulations could result in sanctions being imposed on us, including fines, injunctions, civil penalties, failure to grant approval to market Resunab, delays, suspensions or withdrawals of approvals, operating restrictions and
criminal prosecutions, any of which could significantly and adversely affect our business. In addition, we will not have control over the ability of our contract manufacturers to maintain adequate quality control, quality assurance and qualified
personnel. Failure by our contract manufacturers to comply with or maintain any of these standards could adversely affect our ability to develop, obtain regulatory approval for or market Resunab. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">If for any reason, these third parties are unable or unwilling to perform, we may not be able to terminate our agreements with them, and we
may not be able to locate alternative manufacturers or formulators or enter into favorable agreements with them and we cannot be certain that any such third parties will have the manufacturing capacity to meet future requirements. If these
manufacturers or any alternate manufacturer of finished drug product experiences any significant difficulties in its respective manufacturing processes for our API or finished Resunab product or should cease doing business with us, we could
experience significant interruptions in the supply of Resunab or may not be able to create a supply of Resunab at all. Were we to encounter manufacturing issues, our ability to produce a sufficient supply of Resunab might be negatively affected. Our
inability to coordinate the efforts of our third party manufacturing partners, or the lack of capacity available at our third party manufacturing partners, could impair our ability to supply Resunab at required levels. Because of the significant
regulatory requirements that we would need to satisfy in order to qualify a new bulk or finished product manufacturer, if we face these or other difficulties with our current manufacturing partners, we could experience significant interruptions in
the supply of Resunab if we decided to transfer the manufacture of Resunab to one or more alternative manufacturers in an effort to deal with the difficulties. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Any manufacturing problem or the loss of a contract manufacturer could be disruptive to our operations and result in lost sales. Additionally,
we rely on third parties to supply the raw materials needed to manufacture our potential products. Any reliance on suppliers may involve several risks, including a potential inability to obtain critical materials and reduced control over production
costs, delivery schedules, reliability and quality. Any unanticipated disruption to a future contract manufacturer caused by problems at suppliers could delay shipment of Resunab, increase our cost of goods sold and result in lost sales. </P>

<P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">We expect to enter into agreements with third-party CROs to conduct and manage our clinical programs including contracting with clinical sites
to perform our clinical studies. We plan to rely heavily on these parties for execution of clinical studies for Resunab and will control only certain aspects of their activities. Nevertheless, we will be responsible for ensuring that each of our
studies is conducted in accordance with the applicable protocol, legal, regulatory and scientific standards, and our reliance on CROs and clinical sites will not relieve us of our regulatory responsibilities. We and our CROs will be required to
comply with cGCPs, which are regulations and guidelines enforced by the FDA, the Competent Authorities of the Member States of the European Economic Area and comparable foreign regulatory authorities for any products in clinical development. The FDA
enforces these cGCP regulations through periodic inspections of trial sponsors, principal investigators and trial sites. If we or our CROs fail to comply with applicable cGCPs, the clinical data generated in our clinical trials may be deemed
unreliable and the FDA or comparable foreign regulatory authorities may require us to perform additional clinical trials before approving our marketing applications. We cannot assure you that, upon inspection, the FDA will determine that any of our
clinical trials comply with cGCPs. In addition, our clinical trials must be conducted with products produced under cGMP regulations and will require a large number of test subjects. Our failure or the failure of our CROs or clinical sites to comply
with these regulations may require us to repeat clinical trials, which would delay the regulatory approval process and could also subject us to enforcement action up to and including civil and criminal penalties. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Although we intend to design the clinical trials for Resunab in consultation with CROs, we expect that the CROs will manage all of the
clinical trials conducted at contracted clinical sites. As a result, many important aspects of our drug development programs would be outside of our direct control. In addition, the CROs and clinical sites may not perform all of their obligations
under arrangements with us or in compliance with regulatory requirements. If the CROs or clinical sites do not perform clinical trials in a satisfactory manner, breach their obligations to us or fail to comply with regulatory requirements, the
development and commercialization of Resunab for the subject indication may be delayed or our development program materially and irreversibly harmed. We cannot control the amount and timing of resources these CROs and clinical sites will devote to
our program or Resunab. If we are unable to rely on clinical data collected by our CROs, we could be required to repeat, extend the duration of, or increase the size of our clinical trials, which could significantly delay commercialization and
require significantly greater expenditures. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">If any of our relationships with these third-party CROs or clinical sites terminate, we may
not be able to enter into arrangements with alternative CROs or clinical sites. If CROs do not successfully carry out their contractual duties or obligations or meet expected deadlines, if they need to be replaced or if the quality or accuracy of
the clinical data they obtain is compromised due to the failure to adhere to our clinical protocols, regulatory requirements or for other reasons, any such clinical trials may be extended, delayed or terminated, and we may not be able to obtain
regulatory approval for or successfully commercialize Resunab. As a result, our financial results and the commercial prospects for Resunab would be harmed, our costs could increase and our ability to generate revenue could be delayed. </P>

approval of Resunab. In addition, if one or more clinical studies are delayed, our competitors may be able to bring products to market before we do, and the commercial viability of Resunab could be significantly reduced. </P>

inherently uncertain. Failure can occur at any time during the clinical trial process. The results of pre-clinical studies and early clinical trials may not be predictive of the results of later-stage clinical trials. We cannot assure you that the
FDA will view the results as we do or that any future trials of Resunab will achieve positive results. Product candidates in later stages of clinical trials may fail to show the desired safety and efficacy traits despite having progressed through
pre-clinical studies and initial clinical trials. A number of companies in the biopharmaceutical industry have suffered significant setbacks in advanced clinical trials due to lack of efficacy or adverse safety profiles, notwithstanding promising
results in earlier trials. Any future clinical trial results for Resunab may not be successful. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">In addition, a number of factors could
contribute to a lack of favorable safety and efficacy results for Resunab. For example, such trials could result in increased variability due to varying site characteristics, such as local standards of care, differences in evaluation period and
surgical technique, and due to varying patient characteristics including demographic factors and health status. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">We intend to seek orphan
drug status for Resunab for the treatment of cystic fibrosis and diffuse scleroderma, which, if approved by the FDA, will provide us with seven years of market exclusivity in the United States under the Orphan Drug Act. However, there is no
guarantee that the FDA will grant any future application for orphan drug designation for Resunab, which would make us ineligible for the additional exclusivity and other benefits of orphan drug designation. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Under the Orphan Drug Act, the FDA may grant orphan drug designation to a drug intended to treat a rare disease or condition, which is
generally a disease or condition that affects fewer than 200,000 individuals in the United States and for which there is no reasonable expectation that the cost of developing and making a drug available in the Unites States for this type of disease
or condition will be recovered from sales of the product. Orphan drug designation must be requested before submitting an NDA. After the FDA grants orphan drug designation, the identity of the therapeutic agent and its potential orphan use are
disclosed publicly by the FDA. Orphan product designation does not convey any advantage in or shorten the duration of regulatory review and approval process. In addition to the potential period of exclusivity, orphan designation makes a company
eligible for grant funding of up to $400,000 per year for four years to defray costs of clinical trial expenses, tax credits for clinical research expenses and potential exemption from the FDA application user fee. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">If a product that has orphan designation subsequently receives the first FDA approval for the disease or condition for which it has such
designation, the product is entitled to orphan drug exclusivity, which means the FDA may not approve any other applications to market the same drug for the same indication for seven years, except in limited circumstances, such as (i)&nbsp;the
drug&#146;s orphan designation is revoked; (ii)&nbsp;its marketing approval is withdrawn; (iii)&nbsp;the orphan exclusivity holder consents to the approval of another applicant&#146;s product; (iv)&nbsp;the orphan exclusivity holder is unable to
assure the availability of a sufficient quantity of drug; or (v)&nbsp;a showing of clinical superiority to the product with orphan exclusivity by a competitor product. If a drug designated as an orphan product receives marketing approval for an
indication broader than what is designated, it may not be entitled to orphan drug exclusivity. There can be no assurance that we will receive orphan drug designation for Resunab in the indications of cystic fibrosis, scleroderma, or other
inflammatory diseases, if we elect to seek such applications. </P>

<P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Our commercial success will depend, in part, on obtaining and maintaining patent protection for our technologies, products and processes,
successfully defending these patents against third-party challenges and successfully enforcing these patents against third party competitors. The patent positions of pharmaceutical companies can be highly uncertain and involve complex legal,
scientific and factual questions for which important legal principles remain unresolved. Changes in either the patent laws or in interpretations of patent laws may diminish the value of our intellectual property. Accordingly, we cannot predict the
breadth of claims that may be allowable or enforceable in our patents (including patents owned by us). We currently have one issued patent and the three pending patent applications for Resunab may never be approved by United States or foreign patent
offices and the existing patent and patent applications relating to Resunab and related technologies may be challenged, invalidated or circumvented by third parties and might not protect us against competitors with similar products or technologies.
</P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The degree of future protection for our proprietary rights is uncertain, because legal means afford only limited protection and may not
adequately protect our rights, permit us to gain or keep our competitive advantage, or provide us with any competitive advantage at all. For example, others have filed, and in the future are likely to file, patent applications covering products and
technologies that are similar, identical or competitive to Resunab, or important to our business. We cannot be certain that any patent application owned by a third party will not have priority over patent applications filed by us, or that we will
not be involved in interference, opposition or invalidity proceedings before United States or foreign patent offices. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">We also rely on
trade secrets to protect technology, especially in cases when we believe patent protection is not appropriate or obtainable. However, trade secrets are difficult to protect. While we require employees, academic collaborators, consultants and other
contractors to enter into confidentiality agreements, we may not be able to adequately protect our trade secrets or other proprietary or licensed information. Typically, research collaborators and scientific advisors have rights to publish data and

we cannot maintain the confidentiality of our proprietary technology and other confidential information, our ability to receive patent protection and our ability to protect valuable information
owned by us may be imperiled. Enforcing a claim that a third-party entity illegally obtained and is using any of our trade secrets is expensive and time consuming, and the outcome is unpredictable. In addition, courts are sometimes less willing to
protect trade secrets than patents. Moreover, our competitors may independently develop equivalent knowledge, methods and know-how. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">If we

the event that the trademarks we use are successfully challenged, we could be forced to rebrand our products, which could result in loss of brand recognition, and could require us to devote resources to advertising and marketing new brands. Further,
we cannot provide assurance that competitors will not infringe the trademarks we use, or that we will have adequate resources to enforce these trademarks. </P>

searching is imperfect due to differences in terminology among patents, incomplete databases and the difficulty in assessing the meaning of patent claims. Additionally, because patent applications are maintained in secrecy until the application is
published, we may be unaware of third-party, patents that may be infringed by commercialization of Resunab or any future product candidate. There may be certain issued patents and patent applications claiming subject matter that we may be required

regulate broker-dealer practices in connection with transactions in penny stocks. Penny stocks are generally equity securities with a price of less than $5.00 (other than securities registered on certain national securities exchanges or authorized
for quotation on certain automated quotation systems, provided that current price and volume information with respect to transactions in such securities is provided by the exchange or system). The OTC.QB does not meet such requirements and if the
price of our common stock is less than $5.00, our common stock will be deemed penny stock. The penny stock rules require a broker-dealer, prior to a transaction in a penny stock not otherwise exempt from those rules, to deliver a standardized risk
disclosure document containing specified information. In addition, the penny stock rules require that prior to effecting any transaction in a penny stock not otherwise exempt from those rules, a broker-dealer must make a special written
determination that the penny stock is a suitable investment for the purchaser and receive (i)&nbsp;the purchaser&#146;s written acknowledgment of the receipt of a risk disclosure statement; (ii)&nbsp;a written agreement to transactions involving
penny stocks; and (iii)&nbsp;a signed and dated copy of a written suitability statement. These disclosure requirements may have the effect of reducing the trading activity in the secondary market for our common stock, and therefore stock holders may
have difficulty selling their shares once our common stock is publicly traded. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:18pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B><I>FINRA sales practice requirements may also limit your ability to buy

grounds for believing that an investment is suitable for a customer before recommending that investment to the customer. Prior to recommending speculative low-priced securities to their non-institutional customers, broker-dealers must make
reasonable efforts to obtain information about the customer&#146;s financial status, tax status and investment objectives, among other things. Under interpretations of these rules, FINRA believes that there is a high probability such speculative
low-priced securities will not be suitable for at least some customers. Thus, FINRA requirements make it more difficult for broker-dealers to recommend that their customers buy our common stock, which may limit your ability to buy and sell our
shares once publicly traded, have an adverse effect on the market for our shares, and thereby depress our share price. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:18pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B><I>You may face significant

called &#147;blue sky&#148; laws, which (1)&nbsp;limit sales of securities to a state&#146;s residents unless the securities are registered in that state or qualify for an exemption from registration, and (2)&nbsp;govern the reporting requirements
for broker-dealers doing business directly or indirectly in the state. Before a security is sold in a state, there must be a registration in place to cover the transaction, or it must be exempt from registration. The applicable broker-dealer must
also be registered in that state. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">We do not know whether our securities will be registered or exempt from registration under the laws of
any state. A determination regarding registration will be made by those broker-dealers, if any, who agree to serve as market makers for our common stock. We have not yet applied to have our securities registered in any state and will not do so until
we receive expressions of interest from investors resident in specific states in the future. There may be significant state blue sky law restrictions on the ability of investors to sell, and on purchasers to buy, our securities. You should therefore
consider the resale market for our common stock to be limited, as you may be unable to resell your shares without the significant expense of state registration or qualification. </P>

Under the JOBS Act, &#147;emerging growth companies&#148; can also delay adopting new or revised accounting standards until such time as those standards apply to private companies. We have irrevocably elected not to avail ourselves of this exemption
from new or revised accounting standards and, therefore, we will be subject to the same new or revised accounting standards as other public companies that are not &#147;emerging growth companies.&#148; </P>

expenses that we did not incur as a private company. For example, we are required to comply with certain of the requirements of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act and the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, as well as rules and
regulations subsequently implemented by the SEC, including the establishment and maintenance of effective disclosure and financial controls and changes in corporate governance practices. We expect that compliance with these requirements will
increase our legal and financial compliance costs and will make some activities more time consuming and costly. In addition, we expect that our management and other personnel will need to divert attention from operational and other business matters
to devote substantial time to these public company requirements. In particular, we expect to incur significant expenses and devote substantial management effort toward ensuring compliance with the requirements of Section&nbsp;404 of the
Sarbanes-Oxley Act. In addition, after we are no longer qualify as an &#147;emerging growth company,&#148; we expect to incur additional management time and cost to comply with the more stringent reporting requirements applicable to companies that
are deemed accelerated filers or large accelerated filers, including complying with the auditor attestation requirements of Section&nbsp;404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. We are just beginning the process of compiling the system and processing
documentation needed to comply with such requirements. We may not be able to complete our evaluation, testing and any required remediation in a timely fashion. In that regard, we currently do not have an internal audit function, and we will need to
hire or contract for additional accounting and financial staff with appropriate public company experience and technical accounting knowledge. </P>

and disclosure are critical to the operation of a public company. As we are a start-up company, we only have six full time employees which results in a lack of segregation of duties and are at the very early stages of establishing, and we may be
unable to effectively establish such systems, especially in light of the fact that we expect to operate as a publicly reporting company. This would leave us without the ability to reliably assimilate and compile financial information about our
company and significantly impair our ability to prevent error and detect fraud, all of which would have a negative impact on our company from many perspectives. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Moreover, we do not expect that disclosure controls or internal control over financial reporting, even if established, will prevent all error
and all fraud. A control system, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the control system&#146;s objectives will be met. Further, the design of a control system must reflect the fact that
there are resource constraints and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs. Because of the inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and
instances of fraud, if any, have been detected. Failure of our control systems to prevent error or fraud could materially adversely impact us. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:18pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B><I>We

listing requirements to support our application to be listed on NASDAQ or the NYSE MKT. However, the effect of a reverse stock split upon the market price of our common stock cannot be predicted with certainty, and the results of reverse stock
splits by companies in similar circumstances have been varied. It is possible that the market price of our common stock following such a reverse stock split will not increase sufficiently for us to be in compliance with the minimum bid price

penny stock not otherwise exempt from the rules, to deliver a standardized risk disclosure document prepared by the SEC that provides information about penny stocks and the nature and level of risks in the penny stock market. The broker/dealer also
must provide the customer with current bid and offer quotations for the penny stock, the compensation of the broker/dealer and its salesperson in the transaction, and monthly account statements showing the market value of each penny stock held in

related notes and the other financial information included elsewhere in this Annual Report. This discussion contains forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. Our actual results could differ materially from those anticipated
in these forward-looking statements as a result of various factors, including those discussed below and elsewhere in this Annual Report, particularly those under &#147;Risk Factors.&#148; </I></P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:18pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B>Overview </B></P> <P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">We are a clinical stage
biopharmaceutical company, focused on the development and commercialization of novel therapeutics to treat rare, life-threating inflammatory-fibrotic diseases with clear unmet medical needs. Our product Resunab&#153;, or Resunab, is a novel oral
anti-inflammatory drug that is expected to commence Phase IIa clinical trials for the treatment of cystic fibrosis and scleroderma, pending U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approval of an Investigational New Drug Application for Resunab,
which we filed with the scleroderma clinical protocol on February&nbsp;5, 2015. During the second quarter of 2015, we plan to submit to the FDA under the Resunab IND an additional clinical protocol for cystic fibrosis. We expect to commence clinical
studies for both the scleroderma and cystic fibrosis indications during the second quarter of 2015. We intend to seek orphan drug status for Resunab for the treatment of cystic fibrosis and diffuse scleroderma, which, if approved by the FDA, will
provide us with seven years of market exclusivity in the United States under the Orphan Drug Act. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Inflammation is a natural defense
mechanism carried out by our immune system to protect our bodies from infection and injury. However, under certain circumstances inflammation is triggered but is unable to be resolved, resulting in a chronic inflammatory disease. Since each organ in
the body is capable of protecting itself from infection and injury by recruiting inflammatory cells to its site, each organ can therefore suffer from excessive inflammation leading to inflammatory diseases that may cause discomfort, pain, loss of
organ function, disability or even death. There are hundreds of inflammatory diseases, many of which are chronic, life-long and incurable. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">A key aspect of the body&#146;s inflammatory response is the recruitment of inflammatory cells to the site of tissue infection/injury
whereupon these cells act to destroy the infection and/or repair tissue damage. The signaling pathway that modulates the inflammatory response involves the production of bioactive lipids termed eicosanoids by the enzymes COX and LOX, resulting in
pro-inflammatory mediators. These mediators trigger the activation and maintenance of a cellular inflammatory state resulting in the further generation of pro-inflammatory mediators termed cytokines. This fundamental pathway is involved in a wide
spectrum of inflammatory diseases. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">While the onset of inflammation has been well understood for some time, the mechanisms that resolve
inflammation have only recently been discovered. This &#147;resolution pathway&#148; involves shifting the production of pro-inflammatory eicosanoids by the COX and LOX enzymes to the production of anti-inflammatory eicosanoids. These
anti-inflammatory eicosanoids act to resolve inflammation and promote tissue healing. The lack of sufficient inflammatory resolution is a key contributor to many chronic inflammatory diseases. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Resunab is a synthetic oral small molecule that selectively binds to CB2 receptors found on immune cells. The CB2 receptor plays a natural
role in modulating and resolving inflammation by, in effect, turning inflammation &#147;off.&#148; Through activation of CB2, Resunab stimulates the production of anti-inflammatory mediators and causes a concomitant reduction in pro-inflammatory
mediators and cytokines. Because it acts through this natural resolving pathway, Resunab offers a new mechanism to potentially treat a wide spectrum of chronic inflammatory diseases in which the resolution of inflammation (the &#147;off&#148;
switch) fails to occur. </P>

inception through December 2014, our losses from operations have been approximately $4.4 million. Our net losses for the years ended December&nbsp;31, 2014 and 2013 were approximately $2,540,000 and $602,000, respectively. We expect to incur
significant expenses and increasing operating losses for the foreseeable future. We expect our expenses to increase significantly in connection with our ongoing activities to develop, seek regulatory approval and commercialization of Resunab.
Furthermore, we expect to incur additional costs associated with operating as a public company. Accordingly, we will need additional financing to support our continuing operations. We will seek to fund our operations through public or private equity
or debt financings or other sources, which may include collaborations with third parties. Adequate additional financing may not be available to us on acceptable terms, or at all. Our failure to raise capital as and when needed would have a negative
impact on our financial condition and our ability to pursue our business strategy. We will need to generate significant revenues to achieve profitability, and we may never do so. </P>

costs resulting from the issuance of stock-based awards to employees, members of our Board of directors and consultants. The fair value of each option grant was estimated as of the date of grant using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model. The fair
value is amortized as compensation cost on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period of the awards, which is generally the vesting period. Due to our limited operating history and due to the fact that our common stock just started
trading during the fourth quarter of 2014 with very limited volume, we estimated our volatility utilizing the volatility of our stock of comparable public companies. We use historical data, as well as subsequent events occurring prior to the
issuance of the consolidated financial statements, to estimate option exercise and employee termination within the valuation model. The expected term of options granted under our stock plans is based on the average of the contractual term (generally
10 years) and the vesting period (generally 48 months). The risk-free rate is based on the yield of a U.S. Treasury security with a term consistent with the expected term of the option. We estimate the forfeiture rate at the time of grant and revise
it, if necessary, in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from those estimates. Forfeitures were estimated based on management&#146;s expectation through industry knowledge and historical data. We have never paid dividends on our common
stock and do not anticipate paying dividends on our common stock in the foreseeable future. Accordingly, we have assumed no dividend yield for purposes of estimating the fair value of our share-based compensation. </P>

held company with no active public market for our common stock. Our board of directors intends all options granted to be exercisable at a price per share not less than the per share fair value of our common stock underlying those options on the date

<I>of Certified Public Accountants Practice Aid, Valuation of Privately-Held-Company Equity Securities Issued as Compensation</I>. Our board of directors, with the assistance of management and an
outside third-party valuation firm, developed these valuations using significant judgment and taking into account numerous factors, including the stage of development of our company and market conditions. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">For stock option grants from January&nbsp;1, 2010 through March&nbsp;31, 2012, the fair value of our common stock was supported by an
independent third-party valuation. In conducting this valuation, we utilized the back-solve method as the option pricing method, or OPM, to estimate the fair value of our common stock. We applied the OPM back-solve method, which considers the rights
and preferences of all classes of holders to solve for the equity value and corresponding value of common stock, principally based on the price of the Series A preferred stock convertible into common stock at $0.60 per share sold in March 2012. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">For all options granted from after the completion of the Series A financing in March 2012 until January 2014, the fair value of our common
stock was supported by an independent third-party valuation. In conducting this valuation, we utilized the Market Approach to estimate the fair value of our common stock. Under this approach, we considered the market value of comparable early-stage
public life science companies and used the ratio of market value to invested capital as a common benchmark for assessing valuation. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">For
the stock options granted on April&nbsp;11, 2014 through October&nbsp;2, 2014, we estimated the fair value of our stock to be $0.63 per share. This was based on our Private Placement completed in April and May 2014 (the &#147;2014 Private
Placement&#148;), in which we sold one share of common stock and one warrant for $1.00. We estimated the fair value of each warrant to be $0.37 based on the Black Scholes valuation model. For stock options granted after October&nbsp;2, 2014 but
prior to October&nbsp;24, 2014 we estimated the fair value of our stock to be $1.00 with the increase in value attributable to the effectiveness of a Registration Statement filed on Form S-1 (File No.&nbsp;333-198563). Commencing on October&nbsp;24,
2014, when our common stock started trading on the OTC.QB, we used the closing stock price on the date of grant to determine fair value. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:18pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B><I>Emerging

debt securities, enter into a credit facility or another form of third-party funding, or seek other debt financing. The sale of equity and convertible debt securities may result in dilution to our stockholders and those securities may have rights
senior to those of our common shares. If we raise additional funds through the issuance of preferred stock, convertible debt securities or other debt financing, these securities or other debt could contain covenants that would restrict our

December&nbsp;31, 2014. The financial statements are the responsibility of the Company&#146;s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based on our audits. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we
plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. The Company is not required to have, nor were we engaged to perform, an audit of its internal control over financial
reporting. Our audits included consideration of internal control over financial reporting as a basis for designing audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of
the Company&#146;s internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An audit also includes
assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the consolidated financial position of Corbus
Pharmaceuticals Holdings, Inc. and subsidiaries as of December 31, 2014 and 2013, and the consolidated results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the years in the two-year period ended December&nbsp;31, 2014, in conformity with

<P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; margin-left:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Corbus Pharmaceuticals Holdings, Inc. (&#147;CPHI&#148; or &#147;the Company&#148;) is a clinical stage biopharmaceutical company, focused on
the development and commercialization of therapeutics to treat rare life-threating, rare inflammatory fibrotic diseases.&nbsp;Since its inception, the Company has devoted substantially all of its efforts to business planning, research and
development, recruiting management and technical staff, acquiring operating assets and raising capital. The Company&#146;s business is subject to significant risks and uncertainties and the Company will be dependent on raising substantial additional
capital before it becomes profitable and it may never achieve profitability. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:18pt; margin-bottom:0pt; margin-left:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B>Reverse Acquisition </B></P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; margin-left:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">JB Therapeutics Inc. (&#147;JB Therapeutics&#148;), was incorporated on April&nbsp;24, 2009 under the laws of the State of Delaware. CPHI was
incorporated on December&nbsp;18, 2013 under the laws of the State of Delaware. On April&nbsp;11, 2014, JB Therapeutics Inc. completed a reverse acquisition with CPHI. Upon the consummation of the reverse acquisition, JB Therapeutics became a wholly
owned subsidiary of CPHI and changed its name to Corbus Pharmaceuticals, Inc. CPHI continues to operate the business of JB Therapeutics. All the references to the &#147;Company&#148; for activities prior to the reverse merger are to JB Therapeutics
activities. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; margin-left:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">As part of the reverse acquisition, CPHI issued 9,000,000 shares of common stock to holders of JB Therapeutics common and
preferred stock in exchange for a total of 5,964,649 common shares outstanding on an as converted basis. In addition, the holders of warrants to purchase common stock of JB Therapeutics received warrants, or the Replacement Warrants, to purchase
377,839 shares of CPHI common stock with an exercise price of ranging from $0.60 to $0.66. In addition, holders of JB Therapeutics Series A preferred stock received warrants to purchase 917,612 shares of common stock of CPHI. Finally, holders of
outstanding options of JB Therapeutics received, in substitution for such options, options made pursuant to the Corbus 2014 Equity Incentive Plan to purchase an aggregate of 905,334 shares of CPHI common stock with exercise prices ranging from $0.11
to $0.17 per share. All share and per share amounts presented in these consolidated financial statements for the years ended December&nbsp;31, 2014 and 2013 have been retroactively restated to reflect the 1.5089 exchange ratio of JB Therapeutics
shares for CPHI shares in the reverse acquisition. Immediately prior to the reverse acquisition, CPHI had 6,000,000 shares outstanding. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; margin-left:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The reverse acquisition was accounted for as a recapitalization since the formation of CPHI was formed solely to effect the reverse acquisition
and a private placement of equity and CPHI had no prior operations or net monetary assets. Thus, JB Therapeutics is deemed to be the accounting acquirer and successor entity and the historical financial statements are those of JB Therapeutics as the
accounting acquirer. Following the reverse acquisition, the management of JB Therapeutics became the management of CPHI. At the date of the reverse acquisition, the 6,000,000 outstanding shares of CPHI are reflected as an issuance of common stock to
the prior holders of CPHI. CPHI had no net monetary assets as of the reverse acquisition so the issuance was recorded as a reclassification between additional paid-in-capital and par value of common stock. On April&nbsp;11, 2014 and in three
subsequent closings, CPHI completed a private placement of equity, raising net proceeds of approximately $8,402,000 (the &#147;2014 Private Placement&#148;) (See Note 9). </P> <P STYLE="font-size:18pt;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt">&nbsp;</P>

operating losses to continue for the foreseeable future due&nbsp;to,&nbsp;among other things, costs related to research funding, development of its product candidates and its preclinical
programs, strategic alliances and the development of its administrative organization. The Company expects the current cash on hand to be sufficient to meet its operating and capital requirements through at least December 2015. In addition,&nbsp;the
Company will need to raise significant additional capital to fund the clinical trials for Resunab, its continued research and development efforts, to expand its business, to pursue strategic investments, to take advantage of financing opportunities,
and other operating needs. The sale of equity and convertible debt securities may result in dilution to the Company&#146;s stockholders and those securities may have rights senior to those of the Company&#146;s common shares. If the Company raises
additional funds through the issuance of preferred stock, convertible debt securities or other debt financing, these securities or other debt could contain covenants that would restrict the Company&#146;s operations. Any other third-party funding
arrangement could require the Company to relinquish valuable rights. The source, timing and availability of any future financing will depend principally upon market conditions, and, more specifically, on the progress of the Company&#146;s clinical
development programs. Funding may not be available when needed, at all, or on terms acceptable to the Company. Lack of necessary funds may require the Company, among other things, to delay, scale back or eliminate some or all of the Company&#146;s
planned clinical trials. </P> <P STYLE="font-size:18pt;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt">&nbsp;</P>

<P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; margin-left:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The process of preparing financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America
requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of assets and liabilities at the date of financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during
the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates and changes in estimates may occur. The most significant estimates are related to stock based compensation, the value of derivative instruments and the accrual of research and
clinical obligations. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; margin-left:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The Company has granted stock options at exercise prices not less than the fair value of its common stock as

conditions affecting the biotechnology industry sector and the historic prices at which the Company sold shares of preferred stock. </P>

in Research and Development on the Statement of Operations. For the years ended December&nbsp;31, 2014 and 2013, the Company reduced Research and Development expense by $49,000 and $205,000, respectively, for research grants. </P>

<P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; margin-left:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">As part of the process of preparing its financial statements, the Company is required to estimate its expenses resulting from its obligations
under contracts with vendors, clinical research organizations and consultants and under clinical site agreements in connection with conducting clinical trials. The financial terms of these contracts are subject to negotiations, which vary from
contract to contract and may result in payment flows that do not match the periods over which materials or services are provided under such contracts. The Company&#146;s objective is to reflect the appropriate trial expenses in its financial
statements by matching those expenses with the period in which services are performed and efforts are expended. The Company accounts for these expenses according to the timing of various aspects of the trial. The Company determines accrual estimates
through financial models taking into account discussion with applicable personnel and outside service providers as to the progress or state of consummation of trials, or the&nbsp;services completed. During the course of a clinical trial, the Company
adjusts its clinical expense recognition if actual results differ from its estimates. The Company makes estimates of its accrued expenses as of each balance sheet date based on the facts and circumstances known to it at that time. The Company&#146;s
clinical trial accruals are dependent upon the timely and accurate reporting of contract research organizations and other third-party vendors. Although the Company does not expect its estimates to be materially different from amounts actually
incurred, its understanding of the status and timing of services performed relative to the actual status and timing of services performed may vary and may result in it reporting amounts that are too high or too low for any particular period. For the
years ended December&nbsp;31, 2014 and 2013, there were no material adjustments to the Company&#146;s prior period estimates of accrued expenses for clinical trials. </P>

<P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; margin-left:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The Company has no significant off-balance-sheet concentration of credit risk such as foreign exchange contracts, option contracts or other

<P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; margin-left:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Operating segments are identified as components of an enterprise about which separate discrete financial information is available for
evaluation by the chief operating decision maker, or decision making group, in making decisions regarding resource allocation and assessing performance. To date, the Company has viewed its operations and manages its business as principally one
operating segment, which is developing and commercializing therapeutics to treat rare life-threating, rare inflammatory fibrotic diseases. As of December&nbsp;31, 2014 and 2013, all of the Company&#146;s assets were located in the United States.

<P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; margin-left:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">For federal and state income taxes, deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized based upon temporary differences between the financial
statement and the tax basis of assets and liabilities. Deferred income taxes are based upon prescribed rates and enacted laws applicable to periods in which differences are expected to reverse. A valuation allowance is recorded to reduce a net
deferred tax benefit when it is more likely than not that the tax benefit from the deferred tax assets will not be realized. Accordingly, the Company has provided a valuation allowance equal to 100% of the tax benefit in order to eliminate the
deferred tax assets amounts. Tax positions taken or expected to be taken in the course of preparing the Company&#146;s tax returns are required to be evaluated to determine whether the tax positions are &#147;more-likely-than-not&#148; of being
sustained by the applicable tax authority. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; margin-left:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Tax positions not deemed to meet a more-likely-than-not threshold would be recorded as a tax
expense in the current year. There were no uncertain tax positions that require accrual or disclosure to the financial statements as of December&nbsp;31, 2014 or 2013. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:18pt; margin-bottom:0pt; margin-left:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B><I>Impairment of Long-lived Assets </I></B></P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; margin-left:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The Company continually monitors events and changes in circumstances that could indicate that carrying amounts of long-lived assets may not be
recoverable. An impairment loss is recognized when expected cash flows are less than an asset&#146;s carrying value. Accordingly, when indicators of impairment are present, the Company evaluates the carrying value of such assets in relation to the
operating performance and future undiscounted cash flows of the underlying assets. The Company&#146;s policy is to record an impairment loss when it is determined that the carrying value of the asset may not be recoverable. No impairment charges
were recorded for the years ended December&nbsp;31, 2014 and 2013. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:18pt; margin-bottom:0pt; margin-left:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B><I>Share-based Payments </I></B></P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; margin-left:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The Company recognizes compensation costs resulting from the issuance of stock-based awards to employees, non-employees and directors as an
expense in the statement of operations over the service period based on a measurement of fair value for each stock-based award. The fair value of each option grant is estimated as of the date of grant using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model.
The fair value is amortized as compensation cost on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period of the awards, which is generally the vesting period. Due to its limited operating history, limited number of sales of its common stock and
limited history of its shares being publicly traded, the Company estimates its volatility in consideration of a number of factors including the volatility of comparable public companies. </P>

purchase common stock that do not meet the requirements for classification as equity are classified as liabilities. In such instances, net-cash settlement is assumed for financial reporting purposes, even when the terms of the underlying contracts
do not provide for a net-cash settlement. Such financial instruments are initially recorded at fair value with subsequent changes in fair value charged (credited)&nbsp;to operations in each reporting period. If these instruments subsequently meet
the requirements for classification as equity, the Company reclassifies the fair value to equity. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:18pt; margin-bottom:0pt; margin-left:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B><I>Net Loss Per Common Share

of shares outstanding during the period. Diluted net income per share of the Company&#146;s common stock has been computed by dividing net income by the weighted average number of shares outstanding plus the dilutive effect, if any, of outstanding
stock options, warrants and convertible securities. Diluted net loss per share of the Company&#146;s common stock has been computed by dividing the net loss for the period by the weighted average number of shares of the Company&#146;s common stock
outstanding during such period. In a net loss period, options, warrants and convertible securities are anti-dilutive and therefore excluded from diluted loss per share calculations. The following table sets forth the computation of basic and diluted
earnings per share for the years ended December&nbsp;31, 2014 and 2013: </P> <P STYLE="font-size:12pt;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt">&nbsp;</P>

observable inputs and management judgment. There were no material re-measurements of fair value during the years ended December&nbsp;31, 2014 and 2013 with respect to financial assets and liabilities, other than those assets and liabilities that are

support its plan to be listed on NASDAQ or the NYSE MKT. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:18pt; margin-bottom:0pt; margin-left:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B>2014 Private Placement </B></P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; margin-left:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">In four closings in April and May 2014, CPHI completed the 2014 Private Placement and sold an aggregate of 10,260,000 shares of common stock
and warrants to purchase an aggregate of 10,260,000 shares of CPHI common stock with an exercise price of $1.00 per share and a five year term. The aggregate gross proceeds of $10,260,000 were allocated between the common stock and the warrants
based on their relative fair values which amounted to $5,349,000 for the common stock and $4,911,000 for the warrants. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; margin-left:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Net proceeds after
deducting offering expenses were $8,402,000. Aegis Capital Corp acted as the exclusive placement agent for the 2014 Private Placement (the &#147;Placement Agent&#148;). The Placement Agent received a cash fee of $1,023,000 and a non-accountable
expense allowance of $308,000. In addition, the Placement Agent received warrants to purchase 2,047,000 shares of common stock with an exercise price of $1.00 per share and a five year term. These warrants contain a cashless exercise feature and the
fair value of the warrants was recorded as a stock issuance cost and was netted against the gross proceeds received. Certain members of the management of Aegis Capital Corp. are also shareholders of CPHI. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; margin-left:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">In connection with the 2014 Private Placement, CPHI entered into a registration rights agreement with the private placement investors, the
Placement Agent and holders of its outstanding warrants. CPHI was required to file a registration statement with the Securities and Exchange Commission (&#147;SEC&#148;) no later than July&nbsp;29, 2014, covering the resale of the shares of common
stock and the shares of common stock underlying the warrants issued in the 2014 Private Placement, as well as the existing warrants. The Company filed a confidential registration statement on Form S-1 on July&nbsp;2, 2014 and the S-1 was declared
effective by the SEC on October&nbsp;3, 2014. The Company is required to keep the registration statement effective for a period of one year, or until Rule 144 of the Securities Act is available to investors, whichever is earlier. </P>

compensation expense of $193,120 and $6,141 respectively, net of estimated forfeitures. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; margin-left:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The fair value of each option award is estimated
on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes option pricing model that uses the assumptions noted in the following table. Due to its limited operating history and limited number of sales of its common stock, the Company estimated its volatility in
consideration of a number of factors, including the volatility of comparable public companies. The Company uses historical data, as well as subsequent events occurring prior to the issuance of the financial statements, to estimate option exercises
and employee terminations within the valuation model. The expected term of options granted under the 2014 Plan, all of which qualify as &#147;plain vanilla per SEC Staff Accounting Bulletin 107,&#148; is based on the average of the 6.25 years. For
non-employee options, the expected term is the contractual term. The risk-free rate is based on the yield of a U.S. Treasury security with a term consistent with the option. </P>

shares of common stock, which had provisions that included anti-dilution protection, cashless exercise provisions and, under certain conditions, granted holders the right to request the Company repurchase the warrant. Accordingly, these warrants
were considered derivative instruments and as of December&nbsp;31, 2013, the fair values of $19,932 were recorded respectively as a derivative warrant liability. On June&nbsp;30, 2014, these warrant agreements were modified to eliminate the
anti-dilution protection and accordingly these warrants were no longer considered a derivative liability and the fair value of $48,380 shares was reclassified and charged as an addition to Additional-Paid in Capital. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; margin-left:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">To value the derivative warrant liability, the Company used the Black-Scholes option pricing model and assumptions that considered, among other
factors, the fair value of the underlying stock, risk-free interest rate, volatility, expected life and dividend rates in estimating fair value for the warrants considered to be derivative instruments. The increase in the fair value of the
derivative warrant liability at June&nbsp;30, 2014 from December&nbsp;31, 2013 was $28,448 and was recognized in the Consolidated Statement of Operations as a change in the fair value of a warrant liability. </P>
